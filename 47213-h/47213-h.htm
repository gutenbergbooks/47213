<p>The three tales which compose this little volume
have been previously published in the <i>Hartford
Post</i>. “The author frankly acknowledges himself
a disciple of the romantic school,” and his stories
have the dreamy, remote atmosphere which he has
aimed to produce. There is much beauty in these
pale, pathetic creations and they have doubtless a
certain affinity with the scenery of Greece, as Mr.
Dodge suggests. It is the present day Greece of a
modern man’s imagination, however, and we must
not take the title “Greek Tale,” as at all applicable
to the stories in the classical sense. They
might in some truth be compared in style with Mr.
Winter’s poems.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>NEW YORK COMMERCIAL ADVERTISER.</div>

<p>* * * They are, all three, quiet, unpretentious,
gracefully told stories that almost all classes of
readers will enjoy.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>NEW YORK RECORDER.</div>

<p>* * * In method and scene alike the book is a
pleasing variation from the conventional.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>TOWN TOPICS.</div>

<p>There is a charm in Walter Phelps Dodge’s
“Three Greek Tales” wholly in keeping with the
classic scenery in which they are laid and the
classical associations it suggests. Of those fair
isles, dear alike to the artist and the <i>littérateur</i>,
story and picture each take on qualities borrowed
from its rival, and these tales of modern Greek life
are enjoyable largely for their picturesque setting.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>NEW YORK TELEGRAM.</div>

<p>* * * A young author could hardly have a
more auspicious introduction to the public than this
small volume gives. If there is no realism or pretence
to analysis of character, there is something
far better and rarer, in these days of over-stuffed
and over-seasoned “roast and boiled”&mdash;there are
characters that stand out and that live and breathe
by reason of a few fine outlines of suggestiveness.</p>


<div class='adtitle2'>NEW YORK WORLD.</div>

<p>* * * Love stories, all of them, well told in
the main.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">IN Summer, particularly in travelling,
one is very apt to
prefer a simple glass of ice-cold
lemonade&mdash;not too
sweet,&mdash;to a bumper of burgundy
or a tankard of ale; and it has
been the author’s experience that
the mental processes are not unlikely
to follow the example of the physical,
in this particular. For this reason
he is encouraged to submit these
slight sketches of divers persons and
places to an indulgent public.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BASTIA.&mdash;Nice is too attractive
to leave without regret
at any time, and we felt
particularly sorry for ourselves
one evening towards
six o’clock when we saw the disreputable
little tub of a steamer that was
to take us over to Corsica; and as we
penetrated the odourous mysteries of
the cabin we devoutly hoped that we
might see Bastia in the morning without
foundering, for the berths were
suspiciously like the long, narrow
coffin shelves in family vaults and
had been built apparently for children,
so cribbed, cabined and confined
were their proportions. We said
little as we put away our portmanteaux
and cameras and took our rugs
from the strap, but our looks spoke
volumes and we were careful to
sprinkle plenty of Keating’s powder
about the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>A fine, drizzling rain soon began
and we were compelled, much to our
disgust, to leave the comparatively
unobjectionable deck where sturdy,
bare-legged sailor boys were shouting
and singing and throwing ropes and
chains about to no apparent end. As
soon as we had reached the depths
of the noisome little cabin, dinner
was served, and oh, the mockery of
that dinner! Everything was scented
with garlic, and when the flavour of
that questionable delicacy was absent
it was replaced by the taste of rancid
oil. We did not sit the meal out,
and although it was barely nine
o’clock, threw ourselves on our
shelves to try and forget the too
perceptible motion as the little boat
quitted the sheltering harbour of
Nice. Although the sea was calm
enough, the small size of the boat
unconsciously suggested the idea of
a rough sea.</p>

<p>Our sleep was more or less broken&mdash;generally
more, and at six we were
awakened by a fiendish blast of the
whistle which was near our berths, to
an overpowering sense of certain
strange and gruesome odours. The
cabin had been hermetically closed
on account of the rain, and on the
floor about the tables were stretched
in various attitudes of <i>abandon</i> several
human forms, who proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
to rise and shake themselves. It is
needless to say we had thrown ourselves
down fully dressed, and we
made a sudden rush for the companion
way, for if ever there was an
odour that could be cut it was the
one in the tightly closed little cabin
of that dirty little steamer off Bastia
in the rainy, chill darkness of that
December morning.</p>

<p>A hasty fee to the steward&mdash;and the
next moment saw us on the quay at
Bastia, holding fast to our valises,
threatened by a ragged mob of urchins
who would have had but little
respect for the doctrine of meum and
tuum. We scrambled into a musty,
damp hotel ’bus and, half asleep still,
were rattled over the badly-paved
streets to our hotel. And what a
hotel! We were received in a
mouldy courtyard by an antiquated
porter in undress uniform, with a
farthing tallow dip, who gruffly informed
us that we could get no coffee
for two hours and who then ushered
us upstairs to the grimy little room
reserved for us. I don’t know yet
how high the hotel was, but it seemed
as if we were never to reach the top
as we struggled after that wavering
candle. No wonder tourists who
think nothing of a run to Colombo
or Aden or a trip to New Zealand
shudder at the thought of doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Corsica or Sardinia, for anything
more uncivilized than the ways of
getting there I have never seen.</p>

<p>The time passed drearily on as
we waited in the cold, stone-floored
room, but eight o’clock finally came
and we hurried down eager for coffee
and eggs. The dining room was <i>sui
generis</i> and the cloth and napkins
were not above reproach, but we
managed to make out a fair meal
with the exception of the bread,
which was hard and sour; and then
sallied out to do the town.</p>

<p>Bastia is rather a decent town to
the view and the architecture is solid
and not altogether in the flimsy
stucco of Italy. There are no handsome
public buildings, except the
theatre, which is built on the lines of
an old Greek temple. In the square
on the water front, where the raw
recruits are drilled, is a huge statue
of the first Napoleon in the toga and
laurel wreath of a Roman Consul.
It is of heroic size and dazzlingly
white and seems to dominate everything
in its immediate neighbourhood.
Of course the Corsicans are
inordinately proud of Napoleon, and
one cannot converse for five minutes
with an ordinary inhabitant without
his remarking nonchalantly that
Corsica has produced the greatest
military genius of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The islanders are a curious cross
between the French and Italian types,
perhaps inclining more to the latter.
The language is a <i>patois</i> of French
and Italian, with a few Spanish words,
and is hard to comprehend, but anyone
understanding good Italian can
easily manage. It is really yet a
question to what country Corsica
should strictly belong, for it has
tasted the rule of many nations. It
knew the yoke of both the Roman
and Byzantine Empires, and belonged
in turn to the Republics of Genoa
and Pisa in the middle ages; when
the short-lived King Theodore raised
the standard of revolt, too soon
lowered. Then the patriot, Pasquale
Paoli, ruled the island from 1755 to
1769, when the Genoese transferred
their claim to the island to France,
which has since annexed it.</p>

<p>It is absurd to say that Vendetta
has died out, for it is still popular in
the island to an almost incredible
extent, and anyone refusing to continue
a blood feud when his plain
duty would be to avenge his ancestor
would soon have the Rimbecco sung
under his windows. A thirst for
blood seems ingrained in the Corsican
nature, and few families in either
the upper or lower classes of the
island are without their hereditary
feud. This custom is said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
worse now than under the Second
Empire, and is particularly prevalent
round about Corte. It originated
when the Genoese ruled the island
and male members were obliged to
take the honour of their family into
their own keeping. There are several
strict laws in existence enacted
against this barbarous practice, but
they have fallen into disuse and are
unregarded.</p>

<p>I have several times been asked
what the principal industry of Bastia
was. The only answer that occurs to
me is to say stilettoes, for really all
the shops seem to have inexhaustible
supplies of this keen, murderous little
blade. Not only are they sold in the
guise of weapons, but as charms, as
brooches, as sleeve buttons, as scarf
pins&mdash;in coral, lava, gold, silver and
brass. Even the pawnbrokers display
second-hand stilettoes in their
windows, several of them covered
with a rust that has been blood. To
a stranger, all this gives Bastia a
savage air, and when he thinks
of the hotels and the food he is apt
to start for the station or the dock.
But Vendetta is confined strictly to
local affairs, and it is very rare to
find a case where strangers have
been brought into family feuds.
The literature of Vendetta is rich.
The famous “Corsican Brothers,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
“Mr. Barnes of New York,” Marie
Corelli’s “Vendetta,” and Prosper
Merrimée’s delightful “Colomba”
all dwell on the subject.</p>

<p>But besides Vendetta, which exists
only in this island; Corsica shares
with Sardinia the honour of being the
only place in Europe where the
moufflon is now found, and so attracts
numbers of English sportsmen, who,
however, land usually at Ajaccio.
Few tourists reach Bastia. Ajaccio
is a sort of health resort, modeled
after the places on the Riviera and
is only a second-rate imitation at
best; but Bastia is a quiet, semi-commercial
little town, on the sea,
with huge mountains at its back, and
content to dream away its time in
ignorant obscurity. All traces of the
old island costumes have disappeared
and one does not know whether to
be amused or sad at the pathetic
attempt to imitate French fashions.
The older streets in Bastia are curious.
They differ from those of most
old Italian towns in being paved with
large, flat stones and are kept scrupulously
clean, showing their French
origin. The old citadel, built in
1383, is worth a visit for the sake of
its curious walls. In poking about
among the old curiosity shops I unearthed
a valuable souvenir. It was
an old bronze medal, bearing on one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
side “Louis Napoleon Bonaparte,”
with his portrait, and on the other
“Pour Valeur.” It had evidently
been given as a reward of valor by
Napoleon III. in the eventful two
years when he was Prince-President,
before the <i>coup d’état</i>, and I have
since ascertained its rarity. A drive
in the country about Bastia shows a
landscape rich in hills and pines, but
in nothing else.</p>

<p>A diligent search among the grocers’
shops finally unearthed a tin
of “picnic tongue,” and we feasted
on that and on some Albert biscuits
to save ourselves a return to the too
odourous hotel dining room. We did
not regret sailing for Sardinia that
night, as we hoped to find there
what we had missed in Corsica&mdash;clean
beds and decent food.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CANNES.&mdash;Any one with a
liking for titles, that is,
English titles, which are
the only ones worth having,
is sure to be gratified
at Cannes. For Cannes is like
Bournemouth, select and expensive.
At the <i>Prince de Galles</i> Hotel in
Cannes the other day, when the register
was brought to me to sign, I
noticed that for five pages mine was
the only name of a commoner.
Earls were as thick as blackberries
and there were Viscounts galore.
This explains why so few, comparatively,
are met with at the other
Riviera resorts. Cannes is <i>par excellence</i>
an English resort, and woe
betide the <i>bourgeois</i> Frenchman or
spectacled German who innocently
happens upon one of its mammoth
hotels; and many are the shivers
that shake his <i>Jäger</i>-clothed frame at
the numerous open windows and delightful
draughts of fresh air that
are so home-like to an Englishman
or a civilized American.</p>

<p>Like Bournemouth, Cannes is rich
in pines and poor in shops and cabs.
But here every one brings their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
turn-out, and few teams are to be
seen without both footman and
coachman in some well-known London
livery. For amusements Cannes
is a poor place, that is, for theatres;
but there is plenty of tennis, which
one may, if properly introduced,
play with Russian Grand-Duchesses
or Austrian Archdukes; and the
Grand Duke Michael is working up
some excitement over golf links.
He did me the honour to ask for my
subscription, but as I am not in
Cannes <i>en permanence</i> I was not
obliged to subscribe. One can go to
twenty teas in an afternoon, if one
is so disposed, and “<i>pique-niques</i>,”
dances and dinners are almost too
numerous to count. At Rumpelmayer’s
the “<i>Hig-lif</i>” of Cannes, as
the French call it, is to be met between
five and six o’clock, when
most of the <i>habitués</i> of Rotten Row
happen in for a cup of the delicious
chocolate tempered with whipped
cream of which Rumpelmayer makes
a specialty. All the villa owners at
Cannes (for there are very few villas
rented here; if one wants a house
in Cannes one must build it) send to
Regent Street for whatever they
want, consequently no shops at
Cannes but those making a specialty
of kitchen necessaries or provisions
have any <i>raison d’être</i> and they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
not missed. Most of the hotels
have good libraries, and one can
lounge away days in the palm-shaded
garden, watching the sunshine
dance and sparkle upon the
rich blue sea. There is a restful
feeling about Cannes, an aristocratic
repose and seclusion not
shared by any of the other resorts
on the coast, except, perhaps, in a
modified degree, by San Remo; and
physicians say the air here is not so
stimulating as at Nice and Mentone.
Of course, it is not so stimulating
as at Monte Carlo, either, but that is
for a different reason!</p>

<p>No one can get a footing at Cannes
unless their social record is unassailable,
and as it costs a small fortune to
live here for even a week, objectionable
people are kept away, and one
does not meet the cockney Londoner
who drops his h’s promiscuously
or the shoddy American who speaks
with a twang and is always looking
for a spittoon. Even the cooking is
English at Cannes, and cold “ros-bif”
and pickles with a tankard of ale and
a bit of apple tart (than which there
is no more palatable luncheon) often
forms the meal of some hearty party
of Britons. One leaves Cannes with
regret; and a sigh for its quiet pleasures
as one is whirled into the noisy,
huge station at Nice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>One finds here a very different atmosphere.
All is gaiety, noise and
bustle. Splendid shops thrust their
wonderfully arranged windows upon
one’s notice. Redfern’s name appears
in gilt with the Prince of
Wales’ plumes above it, and many
names familiar to frequenters of the
Paris jewellers’ shops are met with.
Strolling along the Quai Masséna
one could spend hours simply looking
in the shop windows at pearl pins
marked at £1,000, or at some little
pink emerald worth a fortune simply
because it does not happen to be
green. And the famous Galignani
library is not to be ignored, with its
fascinating display of all the latest
London books and the Christmas
numbers of the English papers
with their half-hidden pictures of
Santa Claus; nor the huge Casino
and Winter Garden where one pays
two francs for a ticket of admission,
good for the whole day, where reading-rooms
and the latest telegrams
of Reuter’s Agency tempt one to
settle down for several hours.
There, in the domed central garden,
among hundreds of palms and tropical
plants, one can listen to a capital
band while having an ice from
the Nice Bignon’s.</p>

<p>There, too, one may see a good
exhibition of marionettes, a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
glorified Punch and Judy show,
where all the gilded infancy of Nice
congregates to enjoy the fun. And
one can waste hours over the <i>petits
chevaux</i>; where, on a huge, green-clothed
table, six small horses are
wound up, and race around a circle,
bets being made upon the colour and
number of the winner. In the
height of the season the management
is said to make 3,000 francs
per day out of this simple amusement.
At the far end of this pleasant
Jardin d’Hiver is the entrance
to the small play-house connected
with it; but the companies who perform
here are not above reproach;
except during Carnival, when no expense
is spared to secure the best
talent, and the Paris play-houses are
called upon to contribute their best
actors for the edification of the visitors.
A stroll among the Nice
shops in the evening is delightful, in
the warm balmy air, with the moonlight
over all and the echo of some
mandolin concert in the distance.
One can listen to street musicians in
this sunny land without any fear of
hearing “Comrades” or “Ask a
P’leeceman,” and may even reasonably
expect something decent in the
way of selections from “Carmen”
or “Dinorah,” both of which are
prime favorites among the lower<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
classes. Nice has long had a municipal
theatre, but this is not well supported,
and the most flourishing establishment
of this sort in the town
is a huge music hall or <i>café concert</i>,
which does a roaring business.
Sweet-shops abound in Nice and are
a never-ending surprise to English
folk, who very sensibly put them
down to the increasing number of
Americans who come here. A huge
Casino has just been built on the end
of a long pier stretching out into the
sea, and they tell an amusing tale of
the way in which the gambling privilege
was secured. An unsuccessful
appeal had been made to the Mayor,
M. Henry, and the speculators were
in despair until it suddenly occurred
to them that their establishment was
not on land, but at sea, and so they
appealed to the Minister of Marine
at Paris with better success.
Charming drives abound in every
direction around Nice, and coaches
go over to Monte Carlo every few
hours. There is but one drawback
to Nice as a place of residence&mdash;the
increased number of the descendants
of Israel who are making
it a seaside synagogue. Fashion
has deserted it for Cannes, but it
will always be the favoured resort
of the gay and the bored&mdash;those
who do not care for society, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
for whom society does not care.
The change to the small station of
Monte Carlo and the gaudily-ornamented
lift that slowly rises to the
bluff above is marked. For pure
luxury and the highest degree of
comfort Monte Carlo ranks next to
Paris. Take the Hôtel de Paris,
next the Casino, for instance, an establishment
owned and conducted
by the Casino company. Soft velvet
carpets into which one’s foot
sinks, Wedgwood toilet sets, and
easy chairs that would not look
out of place in Belgravia, are the
distinguishing characteristics of the
bedrooms; and there is not a gas
lamp in the place; hundreds of little
wax candles, each shaded by a deep
red shade, give light; and when one
is enjoying the cooking, which is a
dream in itself, and drinking in all
the beauty and elegance, it is hard to
remember that one is in what has
been called the most wicked place on
earth. The Bishop of Gibraltar considers
it so abandoned, in fact, that
he has refused to license a Chaplain
or consecrate a Church&mdash;queer logic
on His Lordship’s part, who seems to
go on the principle that the worse
the place the less necessity for a
Church. And yet the villa holders
of Monte Carlo form a very respectable
class. The late Mr. Junius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Morgan had a villa here and many
other well-known names might be
cited. The place is charmingly
small and centres round about the
immense and beautiful Casino. Ask
the inhabitants of the Principality of
Monaco what they think of the
Casino and the gambling company.
They will reply that it is an unmixed
blessing. For the company pays
the taxes of the little realm, keeps all
the roads and public works in good
repair; and poverty is almost unknown.
The inhabitants are allowed
to enter the gambling rooms but one
day in the year&mdash;on the fête day of
the Prince of Monaco. Strangers
gain admission to the rooms by presentation
of their visiting cards, and
without them are not allowed entrance.
A droll tale is told of the
application of this rule to the Marquis
of Salisbury. He was going to
the rooms with a party and not having
any visiting card with him was
stopped by the gigantic doorkeeper.
He was somewhat angry at this and
drew himself up, saying, in very
English French: “<i>Mais j’ai ne pas
besoin d’une carte de visite. Je suis le
Marquis de Salisbury, Premier d’Angleterre.</i>”
But the doorkeeper still
refused and would not let him in.
He afterwards explained his incredulity
by saying to a friend: “How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
could I believe he was Milord Salisbury
and the Prime Minister of
England? He wore a tweed suit
and had his trousers turned up.”
This brother evidently derived his
idea of the appearance of a Marquis
from the Italian article of that name,
which is usually greasy, and fearfully
and wonderfully attired.</p>

<p>The Casino at Monte Carlo and
its tables have been often described;
but the crowds that linger three
deep about the green cloth are always
fascinating to watch. <i>Grande
dames</i> and <i>cocottes</i> elbow each other,
and English statesmen rub shoulders
with Parisian blacklegs. The
day I was there I saw the Duc de
Dino (who married Mrs. Stevens,
of New York,) philosophically drop
£2,000, and stand it better than
a young man who lost five francs
at roulette. But the saddest thing
of all was to see young girls of eighteen
or twenty (the rule is not to
admit anyone under twenty-one, but
of course the officials are often hoodwinked)
with “systems,” pressing
close to the table and pricking number
after number on their cards as
they eagerly follow a run on the red
or the black. These people are
always sure they will some day break
the bank, and linger on from day to
day and from week to week leaving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
whole fortunes in the maw of the remorseless
“Administration.” Each
additional week seems to add to the
strained, eager look in their eyes,
the drawn, pinched look about the
mouth, and the tell-tale wrinkles
about the temples that proclaim an
habitual gambler. The <i>croupiers</i>,
too, are curious studies, as they
whirl the ball or deal the cards that
mean so much to the eager crowd;
cool, calm, impassive, there is something
devilish about the monotonous
way in which they call “<i>Faites vos
jeux, Messieurs</i>,” or “<i>Le jeu est fait.
Rien ne va plus.</i>” Some of them, it
is easy to see, have come down in the
world; and one man was shown to
me who had filled a high position
in a crack British regiment, before
he had been detected cheating at
cards and had been ruined for life.
I may not give his name or all the
facts in the case, but it bore a striking
resemblance to Sir William Gordon-Cummings’
“accident.”</p>

<p>There is a peculiar class of harpies
in the Casino, but very well
dressed harpies, who make their living
by “living up” to the table, so
to speak, and grabbing the winnings
of the lucky but slow players. Enormous
sums are lost in this way by
careless winners, for the ball (in roulette)
rolls so quickly around, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the <i>croupiers</i> toss the gold so quickly
in the general direction of the winners,
that a very quick eye is needed
to spy one’s property. The “<i>Série
Noir</i>” has already begun at Monte
Carlo, and two suicides have occurred.
Of course the “Administration”
policy is to hush up these little
matters, and whenever a dead body is
found in the lonely gardens surrounding
the Casino (about one a fortnight
is the average during the season) its
pockets are pretty sure to be filled
with gold and notes, placed there by
the wily detectives of the Casino, to
show that the poor man could not
have shot himself on account of his
losses at play. And rumour says that
they have an admirably prompt way
of getting rid of the bodies of those
who are thoughtless enough to commit
suicide on the company’s grounds
without noise or scandal. An eye
witness told me the following tale of
a tragedy in the rooms last year,
which he vouches for: about ten
o’clock at night, when everything
was in full swing and the rooms were
crowded with well-dressed people (no
shabby-looking character is ever admitted;
and the devil in this case is
certainly “in society”), a shot was
suddenly heard, and a handsome
young fellow, pale as death, staggered
from the <i>Trente et Quarante</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
table with his hand to his bleeding
side. He fell with a crash, and at
once, like lightning, a crowd of the
Casino detectives had closed around
him, opened a window overlooking
the sea, and thrown him out upon
the rocks below. So quickly did
this take place that not six people
saw it, and the people who inquired
about the disturbance were told that
a lady had fainted from the heat and
from the explosion in a gas pipe.
The next morning the dead body of
the young man was found on the
rocks, with his pockets filled with gold
and no trace of a wound about him.</p>

<p>Lovely Monte Carlo! It is like a
decayed lady-apple&mdash;lovely to look
on, but rotten at the core.</p>

<h2>SAN REMO.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_029-s.jpg" width="104" height="105" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SAN REMO.&mdash;There is a
certain apparent similarity
between Bournemouth
and San Remo. Both are
“winter resorts” and
both are popular with invalids. But
this similarity is only apparent. Frost
and snow were rife at Bournemouth
a month ago. Sunshine and ripe
oranges on the trees are <i>en evidence</i>
at San Remo now. One shudders
here, to think of Bournemouth in
winter, just as in Bournemouth the
idea of the Lake District out of
summer was repelling.</p>

<p>The climate of the Riviera is not
perfect, by any means, but unless
one goes to Honolulu or to “the
Cape,” it is hard to do better for the
winter. And yet it is not a tropical
climate&mdash;or even sub-tropical, simply
one with a more or less genial
warmth in the winter time.</p>

<p>San Remo is not so “mixed” in
its society as Nice, so renowned for
suicides as Monte Carlo, or so vault-like
as Mentone.</p>

<p>Cannes is the only place on the
coast that approaches San Remo
(and, indeed, outdoes it, so far as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
exclusiveness in the “English Colony,”
which includes the small
American contingent, goes); but
Cannes is really a slice cut out of
Belgravia and set down by the Mediterranean,
and one may be in the
height of the London Season all
winter there. Cannes is popularly
referred to as the “Dukeries,” on
account of the number of English
Dukes spending the winter there.
But to a person liking society in
moderation with a few good dances
sprinkled in during the winter and a
fair amount of tennis, San Remo is
an ideal place. Knickerbockers and
cricketing flannels are frequently
seen, and there is none of that striving
after effect so much found at
Cannes, where top hats and frock
coats are <i>de rigeur</i> most of the time.</p>

<p>San Remo is near the French
frontier and so, of course, is a queer
mixture of French and Italian village
life (for it has only seventeen
thousand inhabitants). It is thirty-six
hours from London and easily
reached either by the P. L. and M.
Railway, by way of Lyons and Marseilles,
or by Milan and Geneva, via
the Mont-Cenis tunnel.</p>

<p>The old town, or <i>Citta Vecchia</i>,
is built on a hill away from the sea,
and the steep streets are crowded together
pell-mell on the nearly perpendicular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
hillside. Bradshaw’s Guide
refers to them as “steep, mediæval
streets”; but, although I admit the
steepness, I have never discovered the
mediævalism&mdash;unless the abundant
dirt and endless supply of unsavoury
smells may be taken to represent it.
Of course, the dark, narrow lanes are
garlic-haunted, and that reminds me
of a story I heard here. At the old
Cathedral, an English priest was
talking to an Italian peasant woman
about the next world. She was giving
her ideas on the subject and
ended up a glowing rhapsody in this
way: “And, oh, our Holy Father,
the Pope, will be there on a great
golden throne, smiling at the faithful;
with big bunches of our angelic
garlic under his chair to give to
each of his flock as St. Peter brings
them to him.” If that idea of Paradise
were presented to many good
Christians, I fear their faith might
be shaken, for of all the sickening,
clinging odours, a whiff of garlic-scented
air is the worst.</p>

<p>This old town is nearly devoid of
interest. There are even no curio
shops, and after one walk the average
English tourist comes back to
his hotel to “take a tub,” and leaves
its mysteries undisturbed in future.
To any one, however, brave enough
to pick his way through the overhanging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
alleys and dark streets, up
to the very top of the hill, an old
church presents itself, the “Madonna
della Costa,” where there is a
wonderful picture of the Virgin which
is supposed to be a certain cure for
leprosy. (The method of applying
the cure is an unsolved mystery.)</p>

<p>Most people here go to Mentone
to get gloves and stockings, and
smuggle them back over the frontier
to avoid paying the absurd
prices asked in San Remo. The
new town is built at the foot of the
hill and consists of two streets, with
a few good shops, where the tradesmen
speak bad French and charge
enormous prices for the necessaries
of life. On each side of this new
town stretch the English and German
colonies, the English settling at
the west end and the Teutons preferring
the east. Ever since the
Emperor Frederick lived in a villa
here the east end has been a resort
for patriotic Germans who want the
warm breezes of the Riviera, but do
not care to enjoy them on French
territory. It is not the most pleasant
part of the town, and English
and Americans are very chary of
settling there, as the more aristocratic
west end turns the cold shoulder
to the unfortunate villa holders
and dwellers in hotels and <i>pensions</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
at the east end, and has a tendency
to consider them doubtful or
<i>déclassé</i>.</p>

<p>The west end has all the best
hotels and <i>pensions</i> as well as villas
scattered along the pretty Promenade
overlooking the sea and bordered
with wide-branching date
palms. The Promenade ends in
lovely gardens, and both Promenade
and gardens are called after the late
Empress of Russia, who spent a
winter here early in the seventies.
The Promenade is used as a scene
for “church parade” after service
on Sunday mornings by the English
colony, and every afternoon, from
four onward, one may meet the
world and his wife there. The
municipal band plays twice a week
in the public gardens, but the performance&mdash;a
rather poor one&mdash;is
attended mainly by Italians. The
language of San Remo is a curious
<i>patois</i> made up of Ligurian Italian&mdash;very
different to the pure <i>Lingua
Toscana</i> of Florence, and the bastard
French heard in Nice and Cannes.</p>

<p>Five days in every week are bright
and sunny, one of the remaining
two is usually cloudy and the other
rainy. The average temperature is
fifty-two degrees in winter. The
winds are hardly ever troublesome,
as the high chain of hills behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
town act as a natural barrier.
Among the many bad shops there is
one really good one: Squire’s, the
English chemist’s, who dubs himself
(but by real Letters Patent) “Court
Chemist to the late German Emperor
and to H. R. H. the Prince
of Wales.”</p>

<p>When the late Emperor Frederick
was ill here in ’88 at his villa and all
his affairs and correspondence were
in confusion, his much-loved wife,
the popular Empress Victoria (who
looks so much like her mother, the
Queen of England) used to have all
her English letters sent to the villa
enclosed in this chemist’s prescription
envelopes, to keep them safe
from Bismarck’s spies; for the relations,
never very cordial, between
the grim Chancellor and the Illustrious
Lady were then at a dangerous
tension and the friends of the Empress
claimed that he did not
scruple to confiscate her private letters
from the English Court when he
could get hold of them. The young
Princesses were very fond of taking
long walks in the endless olive
groves about San Remo, and sketching
the town from either of the two
high rocks that shut in the bay on
each side.</p>

<p>A pretty peasant girl in a small
fruit shop near the Emperor’s villa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
made a small fortune by selling
mouldy pears and sour oranges to
enthusiastic British tourists who
thronged the shop, because the Empress
Victoria had made a lovely
study of her in oils, which has appeared
in a London exhibition.</p>

<p>Another permanent memorial of
the visit of the Royal Family to San
Remo is the constant appearance of
the highly-gilt arms of the Hohenzollerns
over most of the shops in the
new town, which, one and all, describe
themselves as “Court Grocer to the
Emperor Frederick”; “Court Bootmaker
to the Imperial Family,”
when possibly the <i>chef</i> may have
bought some candles from the one
and the Emperor’s valet may have
been measured for a pair of boots at
the other. I have even seen the advertising
card of one “Guiseppa
Candia, Court Laundress to the German
Empress.”</p>

<p>The English set in San Remo
is charming and very hospitable
when one comes with letters of introduction.
The leading English
physician, Dr. Freeman, and his wife
are always ready to extend the
courtesies of the place to fresh arrivals;
and any visitor at the English
Club will easily recall the jovial
person of Mr. Benecke. But when
one comes without letters or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
credentials, the English colony can
be very freezing; as a third-rate
American author found some years
since, when, with his wife, he tried
to take the town by storm.</p>

<p>The country round about San
Remo is full of pleasant walks. Ospedaletti
is only two miles away, and
one may take a charming walk there
and back in the afternoon. It is
an interesting place, albeit a dreary
one, for it is the monument of a great
failure. Some years ago a great International
Company bought up all
the land along the lovely bay, built
splendid hotels and shops, made
good roads and put up the magnificent
Casino still to be seen there.
The shares were at a high premium
and every one was sure the company
would make a huge fortune,
and so it would if it had not neglected
the trifling formality of obtaining
the consent of King Humbert
to the establishment of a large
gambling hell in his dominions.
The result was that he stepped in at
the last minute and intimated that
while he had no objections to a
Casino, he was not prepared to allow
games of chance. Of course, this
ruined not only the company, but
the place, for Ospedaletti’s only
<i>raison d’être</i> was in the Casino, and
the Casino’s in the roulette table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
The hotels and shops are all closed
now and the beautiful building is
gradually falling to pieces from decay.
The roads are all overgrown,
and a few poor Italian families are
the only representatives of the gay
world that was to make Ospedaletti
a successful rival of Monte Carlo.</p>

<p>Then, beyond, is the town of Bordighera,
an Anglo-Italian resort
nearer the frontier and especially
loved by consumptives. George
McDonald, the Scotch author, has a
beautiful house there and his daughters
are famous in the tennis courts
along the Riviera. Bordighera is a
garden of palms and supplies all the
churches of Rome on Palm Sunday.</p>

<p>A more interesting walk from San
Remo is to take the Corniche road as
far as the Pietra Lunga on the east
side of San Remo, and then to strike
inland through the olive groves until
one finds the dreary village of Bussana,
a place totally destroyed by
the earthquake of 1886. The ruins
of the quaint old church are still
shown (with the inevitable monogram
of the Virgin on everything),
where a service was being held
when the first shock came on that
eventful Sunday. The peasants say
there are still bodies hidden under
the massive masonry and swear that
the place is haunted. This was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
earthquake that startled Cannes
early on the same morning, when
walls were falling and people flying
from the hotels and houses in various
stages of undress. The Prince
of Wales was there then on his
yearly visit to the Riviera, and one
of his valets rushed in to call him
at five o’clock for the hotel walls had
fallen at the back, and there was
danger that the others might go.
But the Prince only scolded the
valet sleepily for waking him and refused
to get up in spite of the man’s
entreaties, finally turning over and
going to sleep again amid the noise
of falling chimneys and crashing
walls. It is needless to say that H.
R. H. was not injured and that the
other walls did not fall.</p>

<p>The local government of San
Remo is vested in the Syndic, the
jovial <i>Cavvaliere</i> Bartolomeo Aquasciati,
who is practically elected for
life and who has an almost despotic
authority over the civil affairs
of the town; while the <i>Sous Prefect</i>
is at the head of the police and ranks
above the Colonel of the regiment of
Bersaglieri (or sharpshooters) now
here.</p>

<p>San Remo is particularly suited,
on account of its peculiarly antiseptic
climate, to persons troubled with
throat complaints, and several really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wonderful cures have been wrought
by its balmy air. Living is much
cheaper than in Cannes, Nice or
Mentone; there is capital medical
advice available, and very pleasant
society. The old rhyme that applies
to Zante:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">“Zante, Zante,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Fior di Levante,”</span></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class='unindent'>might be paraphrased to suit San
Remo, for it is certainly the <i>fine
fleur</i> of the Riviera.</div>

<h2>THE CITY OF PALACES.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_040-g.jpg" width="115" height="107" alt="B" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">GENOA.&mdash;Streets of palaces,
dingy and dirty
with the mould of ages,
but with interiors
adorned with all the
lavish luxury of the East, such is
Genoa to the cursory view. The
tourist, rushing through the Cathedral
and the Cemetery, his Murray in
hand; hastily conning the names of
old masters and then going away
satisfied, does not begin to know his
Genoa.</p>

<p>It is a city to linger in, to study
slowly and lovingly, to muse over,
in its deserted squares and sleepy
parks. Certainly it is a famous introduction
to Italian art. Every one
knows it was called La Superba in
the old days, so there is no need for
me to do anything but jot down a
few random memories of the place.
Genoa, of course, is chiefly interesting
on account of its past, not its
present, but it may be as well to say
that its capacious harbour accommodates
steamers sailing daily to
nearly every port in the Mediterranean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and that in 1888 the total
tonnage entered amounted to 3,000,000
tons. The lanterna or lighthouse
in the harbour is old enough to
be a curiosity, for it was built in
1547, and is apparently good for
another couple of centuries. Near
its foot are the dockyard and arsenal,
which were established in 1276. But
since 1860 the Italian government
has made Spezia its chief dockyard,
to the disgust of the Genoese.</p>

<p>The one wide modern street in
Genoa is the Via Vittorio Emanuele,
on which are all the good hotels. In
every Italian city and village one
meets this name, and a certain degree
of monotony attaches to it
after one has shopped in fifty or
sixty such streets in as many towns;
but it shows the popularity of the
late king, <i>Il Re Galant’uomo</i>, as they
still call him. The shops in this
street in Genoa are Parisian in every
way, and there is an indescribable
air of cheerfulness and gayety as
one moves along past crowds of
handsome black-browed Italian women.
This word comes involuntarily
to one in thinking of Italian
women or girls. They could never
be called pretty, or even beautiful,
with their dark, glowing skins, large,
warm eyes, thick, perfectly-curved
eyebrows, and a more or less faint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
down on the upper lip; but they are
undeniably handsome.</p>

<p>Then, too, their way of walking
out in afternoon or evening in full
toilette and with perfectly-arranged
coiffures, but without hat or bonnet, is
attractive and gives a cosy air to the
open street. Behind our hotel is
a long, glass-covered arcade about
the length of two city blocks, always
filled with a gay, chattering
crowd of both sexes, who promenade
up and down, now stopping
to look at the brilliantly-lighted window
of some shop rich in statues
and statuettes of Parian and Carrara
marble, or to sit at small tables
in front of some smart café to eat ices,
or the Italian equivalent, <i>granita</i>.</p>

<p>This arcade is one of the sights of
the city and forms one of the most
attractive features of Genoa. One
often thinks of the gay scenes enacted
there nightly, when far away.</p>

<p>A walk about the town is delightful,
provided one is unfettered by
that abomination, a <i>valet-de-place</i>, or
local guide. Such narrow streets
running in all directions past grim
palaces and squalid houses (but all
of stone, for wood has no part in
the internal economy of Genoese
building) ending frequently in some
odourous <i>cul de sac</i>, or doubling on
themselves, to bring the helpless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wanderer back to his starting point,
after an hour’s walk!</p>

<p>The Cathedral must form the objective
point of a first walk in
Genoa. Indeed, it would be hard
to miss it, for it is built of squares
of black and white marble and resembles
an immense chess board on
end. But there is a pathetic dignity
about it, for it is very old.</p>

<p>It was begun in the twelfth century,
and it is most probable that
Columbus said his <i>Aves</i> and <i>Paters</i>
under its vaulted roof, for he was a
native of the erst-while republic of
Genoa, when that power ruled the
Mediterranean and boasted, like
Venice, of a Doge. There is a curious
inscription above the arches
which part the nave from the aisles,
near the Doge’s gallery, to the effect
that the great-grandson of Noah
founded Genoa and that the nave
was restored in 1307.</p>

<p>But this is only one of the curious
things about this curious Cathedral,
for the verger who was
gorgeous in his cocked hat and
wand-of-office, showed us two huge
pictures on either side of the high
altar, which had been taken by the
great Napoleon from Genoa to Paris
when he conquered Italy; which had
gone thence to Vienna and had
finally returned to their former resting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
place. They showed the effect
of travel, but were wonderfully well
preserved. One represented the
martyrdom of St. Sebastian&mdash;that
ever-present product of Italian galleries,
but in this case the arrows
were happily absent. We saw, too,
the picture of the Madonna, painted
by St. Luke and alluded to by Mark
Twain. It had not grown at all
clearer since he saw it twenty odd
years ago.</p>

<p>A wonderfully beautiful Byzantine
tomb was shown us in John the Baptist’s
chapel, and was declared to
contain the ashes of that saint.
Certainly it must have been old, and
the carving was exquisitely done.
The original chains worn by John
the Baptist were also shown. They
were very rusty! No woman but
the Queen is allowed in this little
side chapel, erected to commemorate
the crime of Herodias, but why Her
Majesty should be excepted from
the rule is not quite clear, unless we
accept the theory of the divine right
of Kings which Kaiser Wilhelm
holds so strongly. There they also
show the <i>sacro catina</i>, supposed to be
made of a single emerald given by the
Queen of Sheba to Solomon. This
vessel formed part of the spoils of
the Genoese at Cæsarea in 1101. It
is brought out of the treasury three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
times a year for the veneration of
the faithful, but no one is allowed to
touch it under severe penalties. But
as I was admiring this and preparing
to enthuse over its associations, the
verger asked if I understood Latin
and immediately launched forth into
the original text of the Excommunication
pronounced against any female
who should dare to enter that
<i>sanctum sanctorum</i> where John the
Baptist reposed. But, alas, if his
accent was not that I had learned at
Oxford, it was still less that of Yale;
and I could only guess at the meaning
of most of his sonorous periods.
We left the Church with this avalanche
of mediæval Latin ringing in
our ears. The interior, taken as a
whole, is impressive. The nave and
two aisles are unusually long, and
standing at one end a semi-gloomy
vista of respectable length is opened
up. There are other Churches in
Genoa, but none so rich in tradition
or saintly relics. The Via Balbi is
worth a visit, for there stand the
famous Palazzo Rosso or Red Palace,
built entirely of dark red stone;
and the Galliera Palace with its magnificent
collection of paintings. The
Galliera family has done much for
Genoa as well as for Paris. The
late Duke gave £80,000 to the
harbour works a few years ago, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
now the city of Genoa owns the fine
gallery of paintings. The Duchess,
who has been dead only a short time,
left her splendid house in Paris to the
Austrian Emperor to be used as the
permanent house of his Embassy in
Paris and (as she was childless)
willed her large private fortune to
the clever Empress Frederick, Queen
Victoria’s eldest daughter, in trust
for deeds of charity.</p>

<p>A description of one of these immense
palace galleries may stand
for all. Always there is a grand
hall supported in part on columns
leading to an arcade-surrounded
court. Beyond comes the great
staircase, in two ascents. All this is
open to the public view, and the
long perspective of halls, courts,
columns and arcades is magnificent
in the extreme. In a splendid suite
of rooms on the second floor of this
Palazzo Rosso is the largest collection
of pictures in Genoa.</p>

<p>The Palazzo Reale or Royal Palace
is interesting, having been
splendidly fitted up by King Charles
Albert in 1842. There are palaces
innumerable in Genoa, many rich in
historical interest and full of pictures
by the old masters, and if one
were compiling a guide book one
could write quires of description
about gilding that cost a million<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
francs in one, and mosaic floors
worth several fortunes in another.</p>

<p>But the crowning glory of Genoa
is its Campo Santo or Holy Field,
where the noble families of Genoa
bury their dead. Imagine vast arcades
surrounding an open space of
several acres and these arcades
crowded with wonderfully beautiful
statues. Each family pays a sum
(no small one) for a niche in one of
these arcades with the accompanying
vault beneath and then erects a
life-size statue of the departed, or
some symbolical figure. Some are
pathetic and tender&mdash;the fairy-like
child dancing on roses, for example,
or the full-sized sailing boat crossing
the Styx, every rope and sail
wrought with wondrous grace in
snowy marble. Others succeed in
being only grotesque. One huge
figure of Father Time sitting cross-legged
on a coffin with his knee
cocked up, for instance; or an unpleasantly
realistic model of an old
man with one foot in an open grave
with his face turned over his shoulder.
This was erected by an old
Count, still living, when his wife
died. And so on <i>ad infinitum</i>.
This is a place to muse, to think
grave thoughts and to reflect upon
sudden death, but not a place to get
up an appetite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Genoa is an attractive city, although
they say that, unlike Florence
and Pisa, it is not an economical
town for strangers of limited
means and that lodgings are scarce.</p>

<p>The character of the inhabitants
betrays little of the fiery valour that
gave Genoa its proud position in the
Middle Ages. Now its people are
quiet, hard-working and practical;
they take little interest in politics
and are well content to live under a
constitutional Monarchy, without
showing any disturbing tendency
toward an anarchistic Republic.</p>

<h2>THE NAPOLEONIC LEGEND.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_049-r.jpg" width="112" height="107" alt="R" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">ROME.&mdash;Prince Napoleon,
the head of the Bonaparte
family and <i>de
jure</i> Emperor of the
French, has died at
Rome after a long and serious illness,
during the course of which,
faithful to his declared principles, he
refused to accept a drop of medicine.
His has been a strange and eventful
life. Nephew of the great Napoleon,
born in Trieste in 1822, he has been
four times in exile. He was born in
exile and he has died in exile. One
of the most brilliant men who ever
lived, one of the most statesmanlike,
his whole life has been ruined, and
the great promise of his youth
spoiled, by the cynical disregard of
the opinion of others which has always
distinguished him. He was far
the superior of his cousin, the Emperor
Napoleon III., and if his advice
had had more weight with the
Emperor, the Republic in France
would still be a hopeless dream, and
the mud of Panama would not have
soiled France.</p>

<p>Prince Napoleon had, of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
no connection with the <i>coup d’état</i>
of the Second December that gave
Napoleon III. the French Empire,
for his claims were indisputably
superior to those of the successful
plotter; and although a reconciliation
did take place between them,
their relations were never very cordial,
in spite of the fact that the
Emperor placed great reliance upon
Prince Napoleon’s judgment. It
may be safely said that if Prince
Napoleon had been in Paris during
the fatal days of 1870, the unfortunate
war with Prussia would never
have been declared. It is ancient
history now that the Empress Eugénie
was the cause of that war,
and in private conversation often
referred to it as “<i>Ma Guerre</i>.”</p>

<p>Not long since I met the famous
Doctor Cordes of Geneva, who had
been called in consultation by the
Emperor before he started on the
fatal campaign that culminated in
Sedan; and he told me that the
Emperor was simply a child in the
hands of the Empress, for he was, at
that time, suffering the most terrible
agony from stone in the bladder.
At that time, however, Prince Napoleon
was traveling in Spitzbergen with
his <i>bon amis</i>, Ernest Renan, the
clever author of the “<i>Vie de Jésus</i>,”
and knew nothing of passing events.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
A warning dispatch was indeed sent
to him, but he shrugged his shoulders
on receiving it and remarked that
although the members of the government
in France were “<i>imbeciles</i>,” still
they were not all fools.</p>

<p>But events proved that they were,
and Prince Napoleon hurried back
upon the declaration of war, meeting
with a hostile reception on his way
through Scotland, where the sympathies
of the people were with Prussia.
He found the French Ambassador in
London, M. de la Vallette, jubilant
and repeating the boomerang-like
phrase, “<i>A Berlin</i>.” The Prince
foretold the result clearly and exactly,
and after Sedan quietly devoted
himself to scientific pursuits
until the time for the third Empire
should arrive. He had never liked
the Empress Eugénie. He saw
clearly the mistake the Emperor had
made in not allying himself with one
of the reigning houses; and in espousing
the beautiful Mademoiselle
de Montijo. He assumed a spiteful
attitude toward the Empress whom
he called “<i>Ni-Ni</i>,” and once refused
to drink her health in public.</p>

<p>M. Renan says of him that his
grasp of a subject was wonderful,
his wit extraordinary, and his executive
ability unsurpassed. His sister,
the brilliant Princess Mathilde, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
shares so many of his gifts, has the
only <i>salon</i> in Paris to-day, and with
her brother’s death and the union of
his party it will become historical.</p>

<p>Prince Napoleon was so reserved
that he went through life without
inspiring or receiving any real affection,
and without meaning it he unconsciously
repelled adherents who
wished to become devoted. He had
the misfortune of passing for a Republican
under the Empire and for
an Imperialist under the Republic,
which was the more unfortunate as
he despised all forms of government,
and in his ambition to rule would
have put up with any. A curious
thing about him was the fact that his
followers liked him better at a distance.
Only the other day one of
his staunchest friends exclaimed: “I
never liked him so well as now, when
I know I shall not see him again.”</p>

<p>At a distance people remembered
only his brilliancy, culture, eloquence
and the surprising ease with which
he mastered every problem, however
difficult, in public affairs. He was
superior everywhere and popular nowhere,
and although he had the personal
magnetism which enforces
admiration at first sight, he had also
the unfortunate power of inducing
antipathy toward him on further
acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The deceased Prince’s life was in
all its vicissitudes an extraordinary
one and is rich in anecdotes and
stories. His career was a succession
of false steps, and again and again
the cup of power was at his lips,
only to be dashed to the ground by
his own mistake. A man of majestic
person, high ambitions and unexcelled
ability, his singular lack of
tact and knack of doing the wrong
thing in the right place ruined his
chances of success.</p>

<p>Prince Jerome Napoleon, or the
Emperor Napoleon the Fifth&mdash;to
give him his real title&mdash;was the son
of Jerome Bonaparte (the brother of
the great Napoleon), King of Westphalia,
by his marriage with the
Princess Catherine of Wurtemburg.
He was brought up in Rome, Austria
and Geneva, and finished his education
under the supervision of his
uncle, the King of Wurtemburg, at
the military school of Ludwisburg,
near Stuttgart. On the establishment
of the Empire, under his
cousin, he took rank as Heir Apparent
before the Prince Imperial’s
birth, after which he became Heir
Presumptive, and was for some time
Governor-General of Algeria. The
Emperor often employed him upon
various diplomatic military and scientific
missions. Many people may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
have forgotten that at one time
Prince Napoleon was a prominent
rival of the Emperor. When the
future Napoleon III. was indulging
in various little escapades that made
it seem unlikely he would ever rise
to any great position, fortune favoured
his more youthful cousin.
Prince Napoleon had every advantage.
In looks he was weirdly like
the first Napoleon. I saw him here
last year and instinctively looked for
the cocked hat and knee breeches
associated forever with “<i>le petit caporal</i>.”
No one who saw his massive,
clean-shaven, powerful face could
doubt that he stood face to face with
a veritable Napoleon. He seemed
to hold the winning card when the
Revolution of 1848 broke out, but
every day he lost ground, notwithstanding
his active interference in
affairs, and every day Prince Louis
Napoleon gained more influence in
spite of his reserve. And this illustrates
French nature. It prefers
a man who is impenetrable rather
than one who bustles about and
allows his plans to be found out.
After a few pitched battles Prince
Napoleon allowed it to appear that
he recognized his cousin as the
stronger man, and attached himself
to his cause. But he had no sympathy
with the men who planned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
<i>coup d’état</i>. He distrusted and disliked
them, and they returned the
compliment. But he became Heir
Presumptive, was made a general
and had the Palais-Royal as a residence
with £40,000 a year.</p>

<p>In 1859 he married Princess Clotilde,
the daughter of King Victor
Emanuel, and sister of the present
King of Italy. He leaves three
children, Prince Victor Napoleon&mdash;now
Napoleon the Sixth,&mdash;Princess
Letitia, widow of the Duke of Aosta,
and Prince Louis, a colonel in the
Russian Dragoons. And now we
come to two mistakes generally made
as to the dead Prince’s character.
He was not a coward and he was not
an atheist. Ever since the Crimean
war Prince Napoleon has been
dogged with a reputation for cowardice
and was given the nicknames of
“<i>Plon Plon</i>” and “<i>Cringe Plomb</i>”
by the Parisian mob. There is not
a doubt, however, that he behaved
with all the courage of his race at
the battle of the Alma, and that his
recall was not due to his own choosing,
but to the intrigues of his
enemies.</p>

<p>The report of the Marshal Commanding
confirms this. But a damning
story of his ill-health was
circulated at the time by the semi-official
papers, and the mob was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
ready to put the worst construction
on it. Report says the Empress
Eugénie was in no small degree responsible
for these rumours, for she
cordially disliked him and he returned
the feeling with interest.</p>

<p>Fate was again cruel to him in the
war with Prussia in 1870-’71. When
he returned from Spitzbergen he was
anxious to be given a responsible
command in the Imperial army, but
instead was sent off to Italy to keep
King Victor Emanuel in a good
humour. He had one more chance,
before the war, of redeeming his
honour, when the Duc d’Aumale
challenged him to a duel, but lost it
by too much conscientiousness. He
hastened to the Tuilleries to ask if
he ought to fight. Of course the
Emperor said no, and then the Empress
made her famous but ill-natured
<i>bon mot</i>, “If a bullet is ever found in
our cousin’s body it will be that he
has swallowed it.”</p>

<p>Prince Napoleon was not an atheist.
This is proved by his whole
life, by his friends and by his death,
and will be proved by his memoirs,
for in his last moments, while still
conscious, he received Extreme
Unction from Cardinal Bonaparte,
and he has had a religious funeral.
He was an anti-clerical, and while
certainly not a religious man, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
inclined towards the doctrines of
Rousseau.</p>

<p>The famous Good Friday dinner
at which the Prince and his guests
ate <i>charcuterie</i> and drank a somewhat
profane toast was the base of
the belief respecting his religious
opinions&mdash;a belief greatly magnified
and spread by the Empress Eugénie.
Prince Napoleon never knew when
to speak and when to remain silent,
although a magnificent orator, and
his failing has been well summed up
by a famous senator: “The Prince
speaks well, he is the best of orators&mdash;but
he says only too well what
had best been left unsaid.”</p>

<p>His friends were the most famous
men of the day, Victor Hugo, Edmond
About, Ste. Beuve and Père
Hyacinthe, who sent him his blessing
as he lay dying. His relations with
the Emperor show many instances
of his want of tact. Having been
complimented by Napoleon upon
two speeches delivered in the Senate
against the temporal power of the
Pope, he resolved to improve upon
them, and then delivered his famous
anti-Papal speech at Ajaccio, a
speech which drew forth the following
interesting letter of remonstrance
from the Emperor:</p>

<p>“<i>Monsieur Mon Cousin</i>,&mdash;I cannot
help informing you of the painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
impression which I received on reading
the speech you delivered at
Ajaccio. When I left you in Paris
with the Empress and my son and as
President of the Privy Council, I
hoped that you would prove yourself
by your acts, conduct and speeches,
worthy of the trust which I had
placed in you, and that you would
set the example of that unity which
ever ought to exist in our family.
You have raised questions which no
longer concern our day. It is necessary
to have borne, as I have, the
responsibilities of power in order to
judge how far the ideas of Napoleon I.
are applicable to the present time.
Before the great statue of the founder
of our family, what are we but pigmies,
only able to behold a part and
incapable of grasping the whole?
One thing, however, is certain, and
that is that Napoleon exercised&mdash;first
of all in his family and then in
his government&mdash;that severe discipline
without which all government is
impossible, and without which all
liberty leads to anarchy. Having
said this much, my cousin, I pray
God to have you in his holy keeping.</p>

<span class="smcap">Napoleon.</span>“<br />
</div>

<p>This letter was written in 1866,
when the Emperor was traveling in
Algeria.</p>

<p>After the fall of the Empire and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the death of the Emperor, Prince
Napoleon kept up a sort of armed
neutrality with the Empress Eugénie
and his young cousin, the Prince
Imperial (then Napoleon the Fourth),
after whom, he was the head of the
Bonapartist party. When the Prince
Imperial fell in Zululand in 1879,
Prince Napoleon became the head of
the family. But the Prince Imperial
had made a foolish, boyish will in
which he named his cousin, Prince
Victor, the eldest son of Prince
Napoleon, his heir and successor.
The Empress Eugénie was only too
glad to annoy her hated foe by
pretending to accept this absurd arrangement,
and unfortunately Prince
Victor Napoleon fell into the hands
of foolish advisers, quarreled with
his father and set up a party of his
own. For several years father and
son have not spoken, each claiming
to represent the Imperialist party in
France. But it is now stated with
authority that Prince Victor Napoleon
was reconciled to his father on
his death-bed, and this will do much
towards wiping out the memory of
his unfilial conduct. But he was
strongly tempted. The Empress
Eugénie urged him, all the old adherents
of his great family urged
him, to set up the Napoleonic standard,
while his father seemed apathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
and indifferent. Then, of
course, he commanded a divided
allegiance. Now he stands at the
head of a united party. Thousands
of men who would not join Prince
Napoleon on account of his anti-clerical
opinions and who refused to
support Prince Victor Napoleon
against his father, are now rallying
to the Imperial standard.</p>

<p>Scoffers said the Napoleonic legend
was dead when the first Napoleon
died. Scoffers say so now. Yet
Napoleon III. proved that it was
very much alive in the fifties, and it
is well on the cards that Napoleon VI.
may do so in the nineties. The new
Emperor <i>de jure</i>, is clever, eloquent
and possesses tact, above all the <i>sine
qua non</i> of one in his position. He
has few enemies and many friends
and will inherit the Empress Eugénie’s
large fortune upon her
death.</p>

<p>And so the greatest service Prince
Napoleon has ever done for his family
and cause is by dying, for his
death unites, while his life divided,
his party.</p>

<p>History will judge him fairly.
Brilliant, clever, witty, statesmanlike,
eloquent and masterful, his life has
been ruined by want of tact. His
last words are significant: (I quote
from the London <i>Times</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“He declared that he died an Emperor,
adhering to the principles of
the <i>Concordat</i>, and fully imbued
with the religious sentiments of the
Bonapartes.”</p>

<p>Such was the Emperor Napoleon
the Fifth, a man misjudged by many
and loved by few, but a man whose
talents will one day be recognized by
France.</p>

<h2>A DEVONSHIRE MARKET
TOWN.</h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">NEWTON ABBOT, DEVON.&mdash;At
the first blush
the sudden change from
the balmy breezes of the
Riviera to the comparatively
harsh winds that blow over
Dartmoor, would seem to be a trial.
But such is hardly the case. I am
writing to-day in a private sitting
room of the quaint Globe Inn in this
little-visited town, with the windows
wide open and the sun streaming in
with a warmth that is almost too
genial. One never hears of a tourist
visiting Newton Abbot, and from all
I can gather Newton Abbot is in the
same position. It is a queer, quiet
little market town in South Devon,
about six miles from Torquay, the
great southern watering place, and
not far from Dartmouth and the
moors. One can have hunting and
fishing in the neighbourhood, for
the South Devon fox hounds meet
near by three times a week and the
rivers Eske and Culme supply capital
salmon fishing. Several big
country houses are close by, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
the casual observer Newton Abbot
exists simply to form a coterie of
tradespeople for the benefit of the
County Families in the neighbourhood.
It has no society of its own,
and even its Mechanics’ Institute
gives entertainments only by the suffrages
of the “surrounding Nobility
and Gentry,” to quote from its programmes.
And yet it is a happy,
quiet little town enough, sunning
itself in its own small valley, and
with many of its by-streets running
up the numerous hills at the
back, whose brows are dotted with
genteel (how popular that word is
among the lower-middle class in
England) semi-detached “villas.”
The London papers get down at mid-day,
and until noon Newton Abbot
gets on very well with a local print
which reproduces the news from
yesterday’s <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>By the way, “The Thunderer” is
too dear for the average man (it is
three-pence a copy as against a penny
for the other London dailies) and so
it is lent out to read by the local
library which advertises itself as
“in connection with Mudie’s.” One
rather wonders where the “connection”
comes in when a copy of “Robert
Elsmere” is handed one as the
“last thing out, sir, just down from
London.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>But Newton Abbot has some historical
interest. In the midst of the
town, just in front of the old ivy-covered
tower of St. Leonard’s, is a
remarkably ugly stone surmounted by
a modern lamp-post. The stone
bears an inscription to the effect that
in 1688 the then Mayor of the town,
standing thereon, read the first proclamation
made by William of Orange
after landing in England. Enthusiastic
Orangemen visit the stone to
this day, and zealous members of the
Order of the White Rose curse it
heartily, as they regret King James
and the Stuart dynasty; which, whatever
its faults, at least inspired more
romantic loyalty and personal devotion
than the phlegmatic Dutch
Prince ever did.</p>

<p>I visited several houses near Newton
Abbot with a view to taking one
furnished for the sake of the good
fishing near, and although none was
found to suit I had some droll experiences.
One house was very well
furnished, and the family seemed in
a remarkable hurry to get away
while offering the place at a low
rent, but it afterwards turned out
that the paterfamilias&mdash;a clergyman&mdash;had
just eloped with the parlourmaid.</p>

<p>At another house I was received
by a smartly-dressed person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
tried hard to give me the impression
that she was a lady, and who at
length airily inquired: “And would
you like to move in, at once, forthwith
directly?” But her drawing
room was decorated with wax flowers
under glass shades; and mottoes
done in Berlin wool, with a chromo-lithograph
of the late Lord Palmerston
over the mantel; so I was not
exposed to much temptation. The
occupant of another cottage waxed
confidential as she showed me over
the house, told me her name was
Mrs. Mudge and that she “laundered”
for a living. She looked
as if she did something for a living,
for her face was fiery red and
she diffused an odour of gin and
cloves as she slowly maundered on.</p>

<p>Nearly every street in the town
shows by its name some connection
with the Courtenay family&mdash;Earls
of Devon&mdash;who in the old days
owned most of the property in
South Devon. Now evil times have
come upon them and beautiful old
Powderham Castle, near Dartmouth,
alone remains to them. But they
are venerated still in the county
and the “Courtenay interest” is a
great help to the candidate for Parliamentary
honours.</p>

<p>Newton Abbot has the distinction&mdash;if
it be a distinction, which is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
strongly debated&mdash;of having as its
representative in Parliament the only
Liberal member from Devonshire.</p>

<p>Mr. Seale-Hayne is a wealthy follower
of Mr. Gladstone and is faithful
to his chief, but even he owes his
seat to a prudent refusal to accept
Mr. Gladstone’s extreme views on the
subject of home rule. The sturdy
farmers of Devon have ideas of their
own and do not see why the efforts
of a few Irish agitators should be
allowed to break up an Empire.</p>

<p>The Conservatives and Liberal-Unionists
divide the representation
of Devon between them, with the solitary
exception of the aforesaid Mr.
Seale-Hayne, and the Conservatives
are working hard to defeat him at the
next general election. The echoes
of the great gathering at Exeter last
year, when Lord Salisbury addressed
an audience of several thousand
working people upon the fallacies of
home rule for Ireland, have not yet
died away, and his speech will bear
fruit at the next general election.
The tactics of the Gladstonians in
the rural districts are now devoted
to drawing off the attention of the
rural voters from home rule&mdash;an
attention that, to Gladstonian
minds, is too closely fixed upon the
struggles of the rival Irish parties,
and the probability of their following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the lead of the famous Kilkenny
cats&mdash;and fixing it upon co-called
“rural reforms.” The Conservatives
and Liberal-Unionists, on the other
hand, place home rule in the front
and make it the main issue; so the
curious spectacle is presented of the
party responsible for the measure
placing it in the background, and the
party opposed to it making it the
main issue in the campaign.</p>

<p>Turning to sweeter subjects&mdash;who,
having once tasted Devonshire clotted
cream can forget it? And when
to a glass dish of clotted cream is
added a sunny morning, a well-laid
breakfast table and a hissing tea urn,
life looks at least cheerful.</p>

<h2>OXFORD&mdash;FROM A STUDENT’S
NOTE BOOK.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_068-o.jpg" width="99" height="94" alt="O" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">OXFORD.&mdash;Everything at
Oxford is quaint and
charming, but its inns
are unique and it is impossible
to find one that
sells bad beer,&mdash;the undergrads would
never stand it,&mdash;and where a better
judge of bitter beer than a Christ-Church,
or a Magdalen, or a “Johns”
man is to be found, it is hard to say.
The names even of these inns are
soothing. It is such a relief to get
away from the American hotel abomination,
with its gilded radiator, and
from its cold, stiff restaurants and
pretentious name; to the sanded
coffee room of the quaint, cosy
“Mitre,” or to the bar-parlour of
the “Bell” or the “Plough.” And
although these small, low-built inns
are old&mdash;older than New York City
several of them&mdash;they are radiant
with a fresh lavender-smelling cleanliness
that is never found in the big
American hostelries, where the befringed
and be-ribboned Irish importation
reigns in her pride.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Rosy-cheeked country lasses serve
the public here, and are shining examples
of civil service, while behind
the bar stands a lively, neat and
pretty barmaid, who is an adept in
chaffing the college men, but with too
much self-respect to allow any vulgar
jesting in her domain. We undergrads
were not allowed to frequent
every inn, but the “Clarendon” was
a great favourite, and I have heard
many jolly stories in its quaint old
“Smoke Room,” lined with prints
after Hogarth. When I was “in
residence” at the University, three
years ago, there used to be a very
pretty barmaid who officiated at the
“Plough,” opposite my rooms, and I
noticed that she was usually at the
window when Connigsby Disraeli,
nephew to the great Earl of Beaconsfield,
who was then a student at
“New,” passed by. A queer fellow,
Disraeli, and sure to make his mark
if he lives. I met him at the theatre
constantly, where he always led the
applause. He is very popular still
in Oxford, for he is hail fellow well
met with everyone, be it “town” or
“gown”; and he is “up” on dogs
and horses as well as in the classics.
His kennels were famous when he
was “in residence” or “up,” as it is
sometimes called. If his uncle had
not been the first Earl, and had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
title not therefore been confined to
his direct line (he had no sons), Disraeli
would have been “Milord”;
but he is sure to make his own way.
At the last general election he was
elected to Parliament from the Altrincham
Division of Sussex by a
large majority over his Liberal opponent.
The Queen is said to take
a personal interest in his success,
and Her Majesty’s partiality for his
uncle is well known. He has already
begun to attract attention by active
work in the Conservative cause and by
clever addresses at Primrose League
meetings all over England.</p>

<p>My rooms in the college days were
in Cornmarket Street, near the
“High,” and my landlord (who was
duly licensed by the all-powerful
Proctors) rejoiced in the name of
Huckings. He was formerly valet
to the Marquis of Queensberry, and
never allowed one to forget the fact;
few were the days when allusions to
“His Lordship the Markis” failed
to greet my ears. Huckings is very
proud of his “acquaintance” with
the Nobility, and often boasted that
Prince Christian-Victor, a grandson
of Her Majesty and a student of Magdalen,
once knocked him down in the
cricket field. But Huckings is eminently
respectable and very civil.</p>

<p>His furniture was usually covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
with a green material stiffly
starched, that crackled and rustled
like an Irish-American servant out
for a Sunday walk,&mdash;no English
housemaid would dream of taking
the liberty of allowing herself to
rustle. Huckings was a capital cook
and an experienced butler, and his
welsh-rarebits were as light as air.</p>

<p>There is but one theatre in Oxford,
and that is directly under the supervision
of the Vice-Chancellor, and
no play can be performed without
his sanction. The programmes are
headed “By permission of the Reverend
the Vice-Chancellor, and the
Right-Worshipful the Mayor.” For
Oxford, as a ’Varsity town, is under
the control of the head of the University
as well as of the Mayor.</p>

<p>The unsophisticated crowd in the
gallery always hisses the villain, who
is usually the best actor, and applauds
the hero, who is often a poor one;
but this is usual all through England,
and is taken by the heavy
villain of the play as a tribute to his
genius. Very good entertainments
are given as a rule: “The Pirates,”
Toole in “The Don,” and the inimitable
Corney Grain have appeared
among others. The bar is forbidden
to sell whiskey to the undergrads, so
the call is for “lime-juice,” which
answers the same purpose!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>I met my old tutor, or coach for
“cramming,” in the street to-day,
and I have just had him to dine.
He is typical&mdash;a short, squat man
with a heavy, unkempt beard, and
with countless lines seaming his face.
He has not been out of Oxford for
twenty years and spends all his
time in coaching backward students.
He reminds one in some ways of
a ripe and somewhat mouldy Stilton
cheese.</p>

<p>His rooms are musty and cobwebby,
for he tells me no one has
dusted them for two years, as he cannot
stand having his papers disturbed.
And how he smokes! His pipe rack
must hold twenty pipes at least, and
most of them are beautifully coloured.</p>

<p>The walks about Oxford are
charming and on returning from a
long tramp it is delightful to stand
on Folly Bridge at dusk and watch
the punts and canoes come dropping
down the “Char,” or to see a college
eight dash swiftly down the Isis to
Iffley. The old inn at Godstow, just
opposite the ruins of the famous
Nunnery, is very quaint; and the
fame of Mumby’s cherry brandy is
known to all the colleges in Oxford.</p>

<p>The author of “Alice in Wonderland”
is a Fellow of Christ Church
College, and lives in two rooms looking
out over the green old “Quad.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
He is fond of children and has them
always with him. They tell a droll
story of him in Oxford. The Queen
enjoyed “Alice” so much that she
requested the author, by letter, to
send her another of his “charming
books.” Much flattered, he forwarded
Her Majesty his “Treatise
on the Differential Calculus.”</p>

<p>When I was an undergrad it was
almost impossible to pay for what
one bought in Oxford, for the tradespeople
insist on one’s taking long
credits&mdash;a neat little plan by which
they make a good deal in the long
run, as they charge heavy interest.
Oxford changes little as the years go
by. It was lovely spring weather
to-day and everyone wandered to
the river, through the green Christ
Church meadows, just as they have
done for hundreds of years and will
do in future centuries; and they are
wise, for nothing is so delightful on
a warm afternoon in June as to take
a punt and slowly glide along the
Cherwell, or to drop down the Isis
in a canoe and take a plunge at
“Parson’s Pleasure.”</p>

<p>Descriptions of College life at
Oxford have been done to death and
it is hardly worth while to go over
the well-worn ground. “The Adventures
of Mr. Verdant Green” still
give a fair idea of ’Varsity life, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
“Tom Brown” is as good to-day as
when it was written.</p>

<p>The contrast between American
and English college life is sharply
marked. A short experience of Yale
made me enjoy Oxford all the more.
There is no class spirit, but the tone
in the twenty-odd colleges&mdash;each a
small Yale&mdash;is more athletic and more
<i>Commencement-de-siècle</i> in every way.</p>

<p>A curious thing is the way in which
cap and gown are worn here. The
gown with its two short tails reaches
only to the small of the back, and is
only worn when absolutely necessary.
There has been a good deal of
amused talk “in Hall” over the report
that some upper classmen at Yale
actually wear a long gown reaching
to the feet. It would be considered
bad form for Oxford undergrads to
wear such a thing, as long gowns are
worn only by dons and tutors.</p>

<p>Americans are coming in increased
numbers every year; and for some
unknown reason they usually go to
New College, or to “Ch. Ch.,” as
Christ Church is familiarly called.
But I found St. John’s College&mdash;or
“Johns,”&mdash;with its lovely gardens
and long, low, time-worn buildings,
a delightful place to study in or at.
“Ch. Ch.” is pre-eminently the “swell
college.” Balliol is for hard students,
and Magdalen is very aristocratic;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Jesus is for Welshmen, Wadham
for men who want an easy time,
and Brazenose and Oriel for athletes.
“Johns” combines the happiest features
of each. The others have no
marked characteristics.</p>

<p>The good old dons are a feature
of Oxford, and it is easy to see from
their rosy cheeks and well-fed look
that they do not despise the famous
Oxford ale, which is pure and wholesome,
while the wine is bad and dear.
Consequently everyone drinks beer,
except a few old Deans and Masters
of Colleges, whose gout confines
them to toast and water.</p>

<p>The thought of dons brings up
memories of the payment of gate
fines, if one happened to be out of
college after the great bell of Christ
Church had boomed out the hour of
nine; and it was harder than may be
supposed to dodge the Proctor and
his “bull dogs” if one was out “in
mufti,” <i>i. e.</i>, without cap or gown.
But take it all in all, college life at
Oxford is an enviable thing, and
Oxford itself is a delightful place.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">BOURNEMOUTH.&mdash;Imagine
a few houses set down
in the midst of a forest of
pines on two great cliffs
overhanging the sea; with
a sandy soil, and you have Bournemouth.
There are shops, indeed,
and a principal street, but they are
so mixed up with the pines and so
divided, one from the other, that
they do not give an impression of
town life at all, and one easily imagines
oneself to be in the depths of
the country. The pines are the
fetishes of Bournemouth. You
breathe in their healing balsam, you
bathe in pine juice and sleep on
pine pillows. You walk in pine
groves, and sit on furniture made
exclusively of pine and, when you
die, you are laid under the shade of
the pines. I don’t doubt the fact
that pines are healthy in moderation,
but they are monotonous.</p>

<p>Bournemouth is a new place, for
everything dates back only forty
years. Before that there were only
plantations of pines on the cliff. The
name of the discoverer of Bournemouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
is unknown, but the man who
has “made” the place, and made it,
too, with wonderful taste and skill,
building all the houses in the pine
woods and cutting hardly any of
them down, is Sir George Meyrick,
ably assisted by the Lord of
the Manor who owns the half not
belonging to Sir George. One cannot
call Bournemouth wildly gay,
but it is eminently select&mdash;so are
the prices, which are high enough to
frighten away any one under the
rank (and income) of a Marquis.
There is no theatre in the town, the
aforesaid Lord of the Manor who
owns most of the freehold objecting
to such worldly amusements; but
the inhabitants have managed to get
around him by fitting up the town hall
as an amateur play-house, where occasional
third-rate companies perform.</p>

<p>But people hardly come here to go
to the play. They come for rest
and change. Bournemouth is a
good long way from London: three
hours from Waterloo station, and in
Hampshire, on the border line of
Dorset. The climate is wonderfully
dry, and milder than that of London,
but not warm. Indeed, there is
little difference between the climates
of Geneva and Bournemouth, except
that, of course, there is more snow
in Geneva, and the air is less relaxing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
One can easily understand how consumptives
may derive benefit from it
(lately many have hurried off to Berlin
to place themselves in Dr. Koch’s
clinic), but to healthy people it is
debilitating, even more so than the
climate of Nice and San Remo.</p>

<p>The scenery around is lovely.
Great hollows (locally called chines)
extend to the sea between the cliffs,
and a drive along the coast reminds
one forcibly of the drive along the
Corniche road between Monte Carlo
and Mentone. Indeed, this part of
the Hampshire coast is beginning to
be called the British Riviera, and it
deserves the name, although the sea
is less blue and the sky has a duller
tinge than those of the Mediterranean
coast can show. The neighbouring
drives are full of interest.
The ruins of Corfe Castle will repay
a visit, and Canford Manor, Lord
Wimborne’s place, is well worth
seeing. There are drives to Poole,
a sea-port near, and to Christchurch,
with which Bournemouth is incorporated
for the purpose of Parliamentary
representation. Boscombe Chine and
Branksome Chine are lovely spots, a
little way out of Bournemouth.</p>

<p>Bournemouth is rich in churches.
St. Peter’s is a noble bit of architecture,
and Holy Trinity is a remarkable
building, whose steeple is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
a tower distinct from the main
building. Its rector, Canon Eliot,
has recently been appointed Dean
of Windsor and Domestic Chaplain
to the Queen; and people are lamenting
his departure, for he has
been here twenty years and during
that time has gained for his church,
by his own efforts, the sum of
£40,000.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Bournemouth
have been anxious for some time to
have the place granted a charter of
incorporation, so that they might
rejoice in a <i>bona fide</i> Mayor of their
own instead of having to put up
with a simple Chairman of Commissioners.
A member of Her Majesty’s
Privy Council came down to inspect
the town and advised the
Queen to grant the charter, which
she did last month. Lately political
feeling has been running high over
the election of the Mayor, and there
have been several Richmonds in the
field, one of whom put forward the
fact that he had been for seven years
caterer to H. R. H. the Prince of
Wales and to the Guards’ Club in
London as a claim to the office.
He came within a few votes of election,
but was beaten by the leading
stationer of the town.</p>

<p>Now to celebrate this important
epoch in the history of Bournemouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>,
Lord and Lady Portarlington, who
live very near, decided to give a
<i>conversazione</i> in the Winter Garden
of the Hotel Mont Doré. Of course,
the Mayor and Aldermen appeared;
and now the current of feeling in
Bournemouth is at fever heat, for
“the right worshipful, the Mayor,”
to give him his proper title, appeared
in robes and chains of office&mdash;<i>hinc
illæ lachrymæ</i>. England is
divided equally on this subject;
about half the Mayors of provincial
towns wearing robes and badges,
with cocked hats and the other half
confining themselves to a simple
chain of office. The Bournemouth
papers are fighting the matter tooth
and nail, and one worthy Alderman
(an Irish-American green-grocer)
has resigned office rather than submit
to wear “these relics of mediævalism.”
It will be news to most of
us that cocked hats were <i>en evidence</i>
in the middle ages.</p>

<p>But Bournemouth is really a
charming place and well worth a
visit.</p>

<h2>A DAY AT WINDSOR.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_081-w.jpg" width="115" height="104" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WINDSOR, BERKS.&mdash;“Personally
conducted”
parties have done
Windsor to death;
and the place has been
described so often and so poorly
that it needs a bold pen to make
another attempt. My day at Windsor
was passed during the cold
month of January; when the Royal
Borough was hung with crape, when
the flags were at half mast and when
everything was redolent of gloom
and sadness.</p>

<p>I saw the highest in the land
weeping, and Royalty when overcome
with grief; for the Heir Presumptive
to the English Throne had been cut
off and the nation was in mourning.
The clearest memory that remains
with me after the splendid ceremonial
in St. George’s Chapel, is
the recollection of the bowed figure
and grief-worn face of the Prince of
Wales as he stood at the foot of his
older son’s coffin, between his only
remaining son, Prince George, and
his son-in-law, the Duke of Fife.
He raised his head as Sir Albert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Woods, Garter King of Arms, proclaimed
the “style and title of His late
Royal Highness”; and his terrible
loss was evident to the most unobservant
there. But the funeral has been
everywhere fully described, and it
would be useless to repeat a catalogue
of its many and varied incidents.</p>

<p>After it was over, I walked through
the grassy stretches of Windsor
Great Park with an old Oxford
friend, who had known “Prince
Eddie” well, both on the <i>Bacchante</i>
and afterward at York. He told me
much that was new of him and
several stories of his wonderful tact
in social matters, by means of which
he had averted serious scandal from
a family well known to readers of
Burke and Debrett. I parted from
him that evening with a better appreciation
of the dead Prince and his
character than I had ever had before.</p>

<p>His death has been a terrible
blow to all the Royal Family, but in
the midst of their terrible grief the
Prince and Princess of Wales cannot
but feel consoled by the overwhelming
sympathy that has been poured
out upon them not only by English
hearts; but from Ireland, Scotland
and Wales, and from the greater
England beyond the sea.</p>

<p>There is something infinitely pathetic
about the death of their eldest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
son, just a week after his twenty-eighth
birthday and the month before
his wedding. All England has
wept with the Royal Family, and
foreigners realize as never before
the depth and strength of English
loyalty. The crowds that lined the
streets in front of Marlborough
House when Prince Eddie lay ill,
contained many work-people and
clerks; and the grief and respect
shown by the lower classes everywhere
has been a wonder to all, and
a complete refutation of Andrew
Carnegie’s windy diatribes as to the
progress of democracy in England.
There is no jarring note in the sympathy
of grief, for no word has been
said against the dead Prince&mdash;nothing
but praise and a hearty recognition
of his modesty and hard work.
We shall see, when we review the
history of his engagement, something
of his strength of character.</p>

<p>Prince Albert Victor Christian
Edward was born at Frogmore,
Windsor, on January 8, 1864, and
his names were carefully chosen,
representing two grandfathers (the
Prince Consort, and the King of
Denmark); one grandmother (the
Queen); and a great-grandfather (the
Duke of Kent, Queen Victoria’s
father). The Queen preferred the
two first names, and so, until he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
created Duke of Clarence in 1890,
his official designation was Prince
Albert Victor of Wales. But to the
great mass of the English people he
was always Prince Edward, or
Prince Eddie as he was affectionately
called, for Edward was a name
that held glorious associations for
them and they looked forward to
having another “Long-shanks” on
the throne.</p>

<p>The history of his life has been
repeated so often that it is only
necessary to recall a few incidents:
his two years as naval cadet in the
training ship <i>Britannia</i> at Dartmouth
with his brother; his three
years’ cruise around the world in
the <i>Bacchante</i>; his studies at Cambridge
and Heidelberg; and his
tour in India. He and his brother,
Prince George, had always been together
until their choice of professions
separated them. Prince Eddie
went with all his soul into army
work and Prince George chose the
navy. The grief of the British army
at Prince Eddie’s death shows what
Tommy Atkins thought of him.</p>

<p>During the last six years in England
every one has been wondering
why Prince Eddie did not marry and
settle the succession; and, finally,
the truth leaked out last year, although
long before that his attentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to his pretty cousin, Princess
May of Teck, had attracted attention.
Ever since they had played
together as children he had been
devoted to her, and his father and
mother heartily approved his choice.
The Queen, his royal grandmother,
resolutely opposed all thoughts of
this match and brought pressure
to bear to get Prince Eddie to
marry his cousin, Princess Margaret
of Prussia, a daughter of the
Empress Frederick and sister of the
present Kaiser. But Prince Eddie
was firm and declared if he could not
marry Princess May he would not
marry any one. And so matters stood
for several years. But when Princess
Louise of Wales (who is next in succession
after Prince George) married
the Duke of Fife, the necessity
for the marriage of Prince Eddie
grew greater, as there was a shrewd
suspicion that the great English
nobles would hardly care to have the
children of the Duke of Fife rule
over them if the other branches failed.
But even yet Prince Eddie stood firm
and would not yield, although at last
even the Prince of Wales urged compliance
with the Queen’s wishes.
And finally Prince Eddie’s reward
came. When Prince George was so
ill with typhoid, popular sentiment
urged Prince Eddie’s marriage and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
then the Queen gave in and made the
two young people happy.</p>

<p>The public announcement of the
engagement was received with universal
joy, for Princess May was
thoroughly English, and both the
<i>fiancées</i> leaped at once into great
popularity. They went down to
Windsor together to salute the
Queen, and everything seemed to
give universal satisfaction. Even
Her Majesty relaxed when she saw
how joyfully her subjects received
the news of the royal betrothal, and
the Prince of Wales declared at a
public dinner his delight that his
son was to marry a Princess who
was English by birth, education and
preference. The ground of the
Queen’s objection to the marriage
was simple, and she was soon convinced
that the English nation attached
no importance to it. On her
mother’s side, Princess May is
descended from King George III.
and stands in nearly the same relationship
to that monarch as her late
betrothed, for the Duchess of Teck
is the daughter of King George’s
son, the Duke of Cambridge; and
Queen Victoria’s father the Duke
of Kent, was another son; so the
Queen and the Duchess of Teck are
first cousins; Princess May and the
Prince of Wales second cousins; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Princess May and Prince Eddie second
cousins once removed. But the
Duke of Teck’s pedigree was the
trouble, for he is the descendant
of a morganatic marriage, and but
for that would now be heir to the
throne of Wurtemburg. The English
people found no fault with
Princess May’s descent, and, indeed,
a sweeter, more gracious, more
charming Princess it would be hard
to find. The marriage was fixed for
February, and soon wedding gifts
began to pour in. Committees were
formed all over the British Empire
for the purpose of subscribing to a
national gift. In Ireland it had
been decided to present the royal
bride and bridegroom with a castle,
and Scotland and Wales were planning
the same gifts. Bridesmaids
were chosen and everything seemed
to smile upon the national rejoicing.
When Princess May went with her
father and mother to pay a visit to
the Prince and Princess of Wales at
Sandringham early in January, huge
shooting parties were organized in
which Prince Eddie joined, and
every morning the ladies of the
Royal Family drove out to join the
sportsmen at luncheon. On one of
these occasions, on a rainy, misty
day, Prince Eddie complained of
feeling very cold, and instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
waiting to drive back with the
others, walked briskly home to
Sandringham with Princess May.
The next day he was better and insisted
upon going out with the other
sportsmen. Again he was compelled
to leave them, and again he
walked back with Princess May.
How she must value the remembrance
of those two walks now!
This was on the Friday. On Sunday
he was ill, on Tuesday alarming
bulletins were issued, and on Thursday
he was dead. Oh, the pity of it!
On the threshold of his career, on the
eve of his marriage he was taken.
One is tempted to ask <i>Cui bono?</i></p>

<p>He will have his place in English
History; and the memory of my day
at Windsor will always linger; for I
have seen what is of more interest
than the Castle, with all its wealth of
art&mdash;the loyalty of a people to their
Royal House in its time of trial.</p>

<h2>SCARBOROUGH.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_029-s.jpg" width="104" height="105" alt="S" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">SCARBOROUGH.&mdash;The
seaside resorts of England
are numberless, and
yet there is a curious
lack of similarity in their
surroundings, their atmosphere and in
their class of visitors. Scarborough is
to the north of England what Bournemouth
is to the south. It is select and
exclusive, but the ultra smart London
set is not found in its purlieus. It is a
great place of resort for the old Yorkshire
families&mdash;families who can trace
their descent back to Norman William
and behind him to the Saxon
Thanes and Earls; and who look
with ill-concealed disgust upon the
<i>nouveaux riches</i> who are so painfully
to the fore just now in Belgravian
drawing rooms and at crushes in
Mayfair. Scarborough is not wildly
gay; its visitors take their pleasures
sedately, and the voice of the
imitation nigger-minstrel is unheard
in the land. One needs to be in rude
health to enjoy Scarborough, for the
sea breezes come rushing in from the
lap of the Atlantic to mingle with
the keen air of the downs; and if
one’s lungs are sound it is a delight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
to live. Hotel prices are fearfully
and wonderfully conceived in Scarborough,
but the landlords say people
eat so much on account of the
splendid air that they must charge
high prices in self-defence.</p>

<p>The amusements and distractions
of Scarborough? If one hunts or
shoots there is plenty of sport. Several
packs of hounds meet on the
downs near by, and although the
country is a bit stiff, the going is
fairly decent. It may perhaps be
considered a drawback that hounds
occasionally disappear over the cliffs
in the ardour of the chase, and that a
too-eager hunter might easily do the
same&mdash;with his rider on his back;
but most men who hunt here say
that they enjoy the spice of danger.</p>

<p>Scarborough has two features distinctively
its own: its “Spa” and its
cabs. Just why the long promenade
where the band plays should be
called the “Spa” no one knows, but
the fact remains, and every Sunday
all the world and his wife walk
there for “Church Parade.” The
Scarborough cab is really a small
Victoria, drawn by one horse, ridden
by a correctly-got-up tiger, who lends
a picturesque air to the trap. They
go well, these small horses, and
gallop up and down the long hills on
which Scarborough is built, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
greatest ease. The “day tripper,”
with his ’Arriet, is unknown here, for
the simple reason that there would
be nothing for him to do.</p>

<p>There are no stands in the streets
to display “s’rimps,” “whilks” and
other questionable marine delicacies,
put up in brown paper bags at
“tuppence the quart”; no merry-go-rounds;
no cheap photographic
studios; or one-horse circuses where
the manager is clown, acrobat and
owner in one, to tempt the taste and
gratify the curiosity of the lower
classes. And there are no Americans
in Scarborough. It is too far
from Paris, and too quiet for the
extraordinary specimens of nasal
tendencies, who make an annual descent
upon the Continent and swarm
from Dan to Beersheba. One never
meets them at home, these painfully
rich and newly varnished Yankees
who travel through Great Britain in
great state and pomp, and whose
breeding is shamed by that of the
scullery maid in the cosy little inns
they so disdain. It is really trying
to see the impression most Englishmen
have of Americans&mdash;impressions
gathered simply from these inflictions
who, knowing no one but the
green-grocer on their corner at home,
come abroad to astonish the natives;
and who succeed in doing nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
but in making the appellation of
American to stink in the nostrils of
the foreigner.</p>

<p>Of course there are ruins near
Scarborough, and again of course
the favourite drive is to these ruins.
Another excursion is to a hill overlooking
the town, where tradition
says that unsavoury individual
yclept Oliver Cromwell, once stood,
or sat or performed some other operation
equally important.</p>

<p>Politically, as becomes its staid and
exclusive <i>clientèle</i>, Scarborough is
Conservative; and has no sympathy
with an old man’s visionary plans to
break up a great Empire. Irish agitators
appear occasionally but not
often, and they rarely carry away a
full purse from the collections they
invariably take up.</p>

<p>Descriptions of places are invariably
tiresome. One place is usually
like another, and the best way to know
a town or city is to go there; but anyone
who can picture a town built up
on the cliffs and down in the hollows
between, with stretches of sandy
beach in front, will have a fair idea of
the Bournemouth of the north. The
country round about Scarborough
is attractive. Quaint villages quite
out of the world like Symsbury, are
met with at every turn; small market
towns, like Yarm, where the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
custom of engaging servants by the
“hold fast” in the market-place on
the yearly appointed day still obtains;
and small seaside resorts, like Redcar
and Coatbridge; with Whitby
famous for its jet; all these are
worth a visit. Yorkshire men are
canny, and good at a bargain and no
better judges of horseflesh are found
anywhere. The only drawback connected
with Scarborough is its distance
from London, but that is really
only a drawback to Londoners. The
Scarborough man is rather proud of
the fact. He looks with pity upon
the benighted south of England
man, and has no words to express
his contempt for the finnicky foreigner,
who comes to Scarborough
and drinks sour red wine, instead of
quaffing huge draughts of the glorious
old Yorkshire ale.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">ROSTHWAITE, NEAR
KESWICK.&mdash;A couple
of days since I started
off with a barrister
friend to do a days’
climb in the Lake country. He
promised me a good view from the
top of Scafell Pike, but a rough
time in getting there; and took an
almost pathetic interest in my boots
and “shorts,” hinting darkly that
certain mysterious “screes,” over
which the path lay, would test their
strength and durability to the utmost.
We travelled third class, of
course, for my friend would have
thought me insane to propose anything
else; and, really, we were very
comfortable, as all the seats were
cushioned. He wore the regulation
British walking costume: stout,
heavy, hob-nail boots, thick woolen
stockings, and loose and impossibly
wide knickerbockers; while a blue
serge jacket and a peaked cloth cap
clothed his upper man. Of course,
his short briar-wood pipe was to the
fore, and on the whole, he looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
comfortable. My own get-up was
more ordinary, as I had started at
half an hour’s notice.</p>

<p>We rushed into Darlington station
before long&mdash;an immense
glass-covered structure, with platforms
half a mile long&mdash;and there
changed for Penrith and Keswick.
We began to ascend soon after
leaving Darlington, passing by Barnard
Castle, the “beauty spot of
Yorkshire”&mdash;the tracks lying over
breezy moorlands. We changed at
Penrith, a dreary junction, and
reached Keswick about seven o’clock
in a mist of half-twilight that was
very kind to the distant mountains,
making them appear much bigger
and grander than they were ever
meant to be. Fortunately, we found
the Borrowdale coach still running,
and as it would take us within two
miles of our destination, we were
well pleased. Before it started we
had time to attend a very lively
meeting of the Salvation Army in
the Keswick market-place, where
the tall, thin man who dealt out
freely sundry dismal prophecies, betrayed
painful need of a bronchial
trochee.</p>

<p>The drive on the box seat of the
four-in-hand was glorious. The
moon came out as we reached the
edge of Derwentwater and threw her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
soft light full on the lonely lake;
and, what was of more importance,
on the broad road ahead of us.
The horses were fresh and the road
inclining to a descent, so we rolled
gaily on past the Lodore Hotel,
hard-by the famous falls, until, too
soon, we stopped before the Borrowdale
Inn. Then, with a cheery
good-night from the coachman, we
started to walk the remaining two
miles, our appetites forcibly reminding
us that we had eaten nothing
since early morning; and with a
cheery feeling of expectancy for the
comforts of the inn presided over by
the famous Mrs. Rigg. The lights
of the little hamlet of Rosthwaite
soon appeared and we halted at a
long, low, straggling house, buried
in vines. A tall, stout lady stood
in the doorway and proved herself
to be <i>the</i> Mrs. Rigg by the way
in which she bustled about in all
directions, calling several buxom
country lasses to her aid. She sent
two of them to prepare our much-wanted
supper, while she herself
piloted us to our quaint, low-ceilinged
bed-rooms, where every bed
had curtains. Now, Mrs. Rigg is a
widow, and has been ever since the
memory of man, and concerning the
original Mr. Rigg nothing is known;
but, whoever he was, people take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
more interest in the fact that his
wife knows how to keep a good
homely inn, called by Mrs. Rigg
herself the “Royal Oak,” but known
to all the neighbourhood as “Mrs.
Rigg’s.” Mrs. R. herself is a tall,
stout old lady with a false front
and an imposing cap, and when she
sits in the little bar parlour behind
the steaming tea kettle, reading
the <i>Family Herald</i>, she presents a
picture of comfort not easily surpassed.
Mrs. Rigg is suspected of
a leaning toward the village painter,
to the regret of all concerned, and
dismal are the forebodings of the
aforesaid country lassies should she
yield herself (and her inn) to his
fascinations. We enjoyed our supper&mdash;huge
chops served with mealy
potatoes and foaming tankards of
“bitter”&mdash;and then in the cozy
smoke room (why never smoking
room in England?), we proceeded to
lay out the route for the next day.
Our intention in coming to Rosthwaite
had been to climb Scafell
Pike and, possibly Glaramara; so
we confidently looked forward to
a fine day. But, oh, the despair
when we woke up next morning,
for the rain was coming down in
a steady drizzle and the mist was
floating gently over and about all
the mountain tops within view. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
met with rueful faces in the coffee
room, for now Scafell was quite out
of the question as well as Glaramara;
for, of course, no view could
be had on such a day, and the idea
of wandering along the edge of
precipices in the mist was hardly
tempting.</p>

<p>But an inspiration came to us. It
was unanimously voted a pity to
waste that day, as we should be
obliged to return on the next; so,
after much poring over maps and
guides, we decided to go as far up
Scafell as possible and then, making
a circuit, to return by Sty Head
Pass. This sounded easy and I began
to congratulate myself&mdash;rather
previously, as it afterward turned
out&mdash;upon the probability of getting
back in time for dinner at six.
We had scraped acquaintance with
an “undergrad” from Oxford&mdash;Wadham
College&mdash;and we invited
him to go with us. We hurried over
breakfast, taking care, fortunately,
to eat a hearty one; and then, with
a rueful look at the cozy, firelit
room we were leaving, tramped out
into the rain about ten o’clock. We
knew we should get wet through, so
we took no overcoats and simply
buttoned our jackets tight about our
necks to keep our flannel shirts dry
as long as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The road was very good for some
distance, being the coach road to
Buttermere, so we went gaily on.
About two miles from Rosthwaite we
reached the queerly-named little village
of Seatollar (which our Wadham
friend insisted on referring to
as “Tolloller”), where we turned
off into a rustic road overgrown
with grass, which for some time led
us among pine groves before bringing
us to the famous Borrowdale
yews: a group of fine old firs upon
the hillside. Here our Oxonian
again would have it that the name
applied to the various flocks of
sheep grazing near and pointed out
to us some “genuine Borrowdale
ewes.” It got damper and damper
as we went on, but I ceased to wonder
when I heard we were drawing
near the “wettest place in England,”
the hamlet of Seathwaite, where the
annual rainfall is actually one hundred
and fifty-six inches! There is
not much of interest in Seathwaite
except its moisture and the fact that
it has no public house, as Sir Wilfred
Lawson the great temperance advocate
owns all the freehold.</p>

<p>Here we left the road and struck
up the side of the valley, having
Glaramara and Great Gable in front
of us, two big mountains covered
with clouds; while Talyors-Gill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
poured its rushing, thread-like
stream down the hillside opposite.
Here we first began to walk on
grass, and grass that had been
rained on for the last hundred years
without intermission, judging from its
appearance. But we said little and
pushed on by the side of the beck
for some time, until it became necessary
to go straight up the mountain
by the sheep track, which was marked
only by an occasional cairn or small
heap of stones. It was hard work to
climb over slippery rocks almost
perpendicular; but we persevered
and surmounted the hill, only to find
ourselves struggling in a green bog
at the top. The rain now came
down harder than ever and as the
Oxford man began to whistle “Wot
Ch’er?” we felt gloomy. We pushed
on in single file, each one dripping
as he walked, the sound of the water
swashing about inside our boots
being painfully evident. We went
on like this for some time. My
friend suddenly broke into a shout,
“Here we are, boys, thank goodness,
this is Eske Hause.” “Oh,
then we are half way up Scafell,”
said the Oxonian&mdash;“hang the mist!”</p>

<p>This last observation was timely,
for a thick Scotch mist had now
shut in upon the small plateau
known as Eske Hause, where we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
stood, but as to the derivation of
that name deponent sayeth not. We
stopped here for a few minutes
while our Oxonian produced a guide
map, and with the water pouring
down from the peak of his cap, proceeded
to mark out our path. The
rest of us wrung ourselves out and
paid as much attention as we could.</p>

<p>“We must go down by Sprinkling
Tarn (good name, that) and then by
Sty Head Tarn until we get to the
Pass. Now, shall we lunch up here
or down by the tarn?” We decided
to postpone luncheon until we
reached a lower and presumably
warmer level, and we eagerly proceeded
to make the descent. The
path, or track, was steep and stony
and the stones were slippery. I will
draw a veil over that descent, but
when we got down by Sprinkling Tarn
(a small, lonely bit of water) we felt
like being put through a wringer.
We hurried on, not noticing that the
path had merged itself imperceptibly
in the surrounding turf, until
our Wadham friend exclaimed: “Oh,
I say, you know, this can’t be right.
It’s quite time we were at that confounded
tarn and I haven’t seen a
cairn this half hour.” It was too
true. We were off the track. There
was mist all about us and the keen
rain was chilling us through and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
through. We searched for the path
in vain, until we were entirely discouraged,
when some one suggested
that it wouldn’t be a bad idea to
have a bite; so we stood about in a
dripping group as we got out our
sandwiches and flasks. We were
wet and chilled, and I doubt if Sir
Wilfred himself would have objected
to a taste of Scotch whisky under
the circumstances. But the sandwiches!
Oh, Mrs. Rigg, Mrs. Rigg,
how we blessed you, there, on the
steep side of Scafell as we found that
the ham of which they were exclusively
composed had “gone bad!”
We said little, but we thought hard
just then.</p>

<p>After that we went sadly and silently
on. Soon we found we were
going down instead of up, which we
knew to be wrong, as Sty Head Pass
was above us. And now the thunders
of a torrent swollen by recent
rains began to be heard, and presently
we came in sight of a tumbling
mass of water hurrying along the
bottom of the valley. We stood
aghast, for this we knew must be
Lingmell Beck, and the valley the
one leading to Wastwater, miles
away from the Pass. Night was
closing in and the mist was nothing
lighter, while it was really hard to
carry the wet and dripping mass our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
clothes had become. We wandered
up and down this valley for some
time in bewilderment, not finding any
trace of a path. But at last my friend,
who had been carefully examining
the mountain side, cried but: “Look,
boys, there’s the Pass, way above
us! We must push straight up if we
ever want to get back to-night.”</p>

<p>We looked doubtfully at the thin
black line that might be the Pass,
and which seemed miles above us,
and then, with one determined look,
set our teeth and went up the mountain.
I say went, for we didn’t walk,
although we used every other means
of progression, for we crawled and
crept and stumbled along, sometimes
on our hands and knees, frequently
sliding back with great
agility. I never experienced such
a climb anywhere, even in Greece
among the wild Theban mountains;
for, dripping wet, with our
clammy clothes clinging to us, we
went a solid mile up that hill before
we found the Sty Head Pass.
That, although rough, was child’s
play compared with what we had
come through, and when we reached
the small cairn that marks the highest
part of the Pass, we shuddered
as we looked down the almost perpendicular
mountain and wondered
how on earth we ever came up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>From the top of the Pass it was a
fairly easy walk to Rosthwaite by
Sty Head Tarn, which, owing to the
encircling mist, looked like an immense
ocean.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rigg was at the door when
we got down and looked so cheerful
and glad to see us that we forgot to
mention that ham. But we haven’t
got the damp of that walk out of
ourselves yet; and it is doubtful if
anything but the warm Italian sun
is capable of removing the general
mildew that enshrouds us.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap">AMBLESIDE.&mdash;The chief
peculiarity of the Lake
country is the ever-present
dampness. But once
used to this one begins
to enter into its peace and quiet.
A month here away from the world
would be, to a tired and overworked
man, better than all “cures” or sanitoriums,
for the damp is not the city
pest, but that peculiar kind of moisture
which makes the hard, smooth
turf as green as an emerald and gives
to the temporary visitor an appetite
wolfish in its intensity.</p>

<p>Ambleside is five miles from Windermere
village (the nearest station)
and is reached by four-horse drags
running three times a day. The
road is as smooth as a billiard table,
the horses always fresh, and on
the day it doesn’t rain, a drive to
Ambleside by the Lake is a thing to
be remembered.</p>

<p>Ambleside is a village of a few
thousand inhabitants and primitive,
to a certain degree. The Post Office,
for instance, is in a stationer’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
shop and the drapers’ and tailors’
establishments are one. Ambleside
is nestled at the foot of Wansfell
Pike and is built on the side of a
hill, consequently the streets are
steep. There is but one street really,
and the chemist, the butcher and the
inevitable relic shop are to be
found in it. The village is honeycombed
with lodgings and there are
many inns, for it is a great centre
for excursions. The immediate
neighbourhood is rich in attractions.
Stock-Ghyll Force is but a short
distance off&mdash;through the stable
yard of the “Salutation Inn,” and
although a turn-stile with the sign
“No Admission” appears, one may
enter boldly without paying. The
waterfall is not high but is wonderfully
picturesque as it falls down the
moss-covered rocks and dashes away
through a deep ravine. The Stock-Ghyll
is a favorite resort for newly-married
couples and is certainly romantic
enough for the purpose.
Then there is a charming walk to
Rydal&mdash;Wordsworth’s village&mdash;by
the banks of the Rothay, past Fox-How,
where the noble Arnold of
Rugby, beloved by all readers of
“Tom Brown’s School Days,” lived;
and Fox-Ghyll, the residence of the
late Mr. Foster. Fox-How is an
ideally perfect place, situate on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
side of a hill, with a smooth green
expanse of lawn in front, and buried
in rose vines and honeysuckles. It
is a low stone building with old-fashioned
windows and has a
cheery, hospitable look. The name
is curious and a frequent one in the
lake country. It comes, I believe,
from the old Norwegian word
“hague” (a sepulchral mound).
Dr. Arnold named the three roads
between Rydal and Grassmere. The
highest he called Corruption Road,
the middle Bit-by-Bit Reform (now
called Bitbit Road), and the most
level, Radical Reform. A little further
on is Rydal Mount, Wordsworth’s
home, a charming old place,
cushioned in trees. There the road
goes on by Rydal Water, a small
lake almost covered with rushes,
and then through a gap in the
mountain to Grassmere. This is all
haunted ground, for Wordsworth,
Southey, Coleridge and De Quincy
all walked and mused by the side
of these lakes and on these hills,
and one hardly wonders that they
were inspired by the lovely scenery.
Then, in another direction, one may
walk from Ambleside to the quaint
little village of Clappersgate, which
is made up entirely of low grey
stone cottages covered with vines
and roses. The resources of Ambleside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
in providing day excursions for
its visitors are really unbounded, and
one of the pleasantest of these is to
walk down to Waterhead, at the end
of Windermere, and take passage on
one of the small steamers that run
several times a day. As the small
vessel starts out from the pier one gets
a splendid view of the mountains at
the back of Ambleside, and the little
village looks like a cluster of one or
two houses in a vast amphitheatre.
Then we turn around a wooded
point and stop for a minute at Low-wood,
the big hotel on the border
of the lake, and then go on
past hills and valleys and flocks of
sheep to Bowness, passing two or
three small islands, one of which,
Holm Crag, is a favorite resort of
birds in the winter months. Then
we dart over the lake to the little
island of Ferry, and then go straight
on past a bewildering number of
bays and islets to Lakeside at the
foot of the lake where the railway
station of the Midland line gives access
to Ulverston and the iron country
of Furness.</p>

<p>Windermere is almost equal to
Lake Geneva, and although it has
become the fashion to cry down the
English lakes, it is a fact that more
enjoyment at an extremely moderate
outlay may be obtained in the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
belt of country that contains them,
than in Switzerland, overrun as it is
by the cockneys and <i>parvenues</i> of
every nation. I know of hardly any
greater treat to a person of any
artistic appreciation than that trip
up and down Windermere on a clear
day. Then the drives from Ambleside
are charming. One may drive
to Grassmere by Red Bank, a steep
hill overlooking that lake and Rydal
Water, and also to Hawkshead,
where a very curious old church
demands attention; and to High
Wray, where there is an inn rejoicing
in the name of “The Dun
Cow.” A hill outside High Wray
commands a splendid view of the
hills behind and about Ambleside:
Loughrigg Fell, Wansfell Pike, Nab-Scar,
Crinkle Crags, Coniston-Old-Man
and Great Gable. On a clear
day one may also see Helvellyn.
The road passes Wray Castle, a modern
house built to imitate perfectly a
mediæval fortress. The owner is a
retired M. D. of Liverpool. Another
delightful drive is to Langdale Pikes
and to Megeon Ghyll, a lovely
waterfall rather bigger than most of
the cascades in Lakeland.</p>

<p>On this drive one may have a
capital view of Red Screes, another
of the high mountains. Curious
names are met with all through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Westmoreland. For instance, three
peaks not far from here are called
Harrison Stickle, Pike O’Stickle and
Pike O’Blisco.</p>

<p>There are many curious customs
still extant in and about Ambleside.
Christmas is celebrated in the old
hospitable way. At that time the
farmer and his family are away
at other houses night after night
and one must look for them anywhere
but at home. At Christmas
every Cumberland and Westmoreland
farmer gives two banquets,
one called “t’auld foak’s neet” and
the other, “t’young foak’s neet;”
the first of which is for those who
are married and the second for
those who are single. The tables
groan under old-fashioned dainties:
raised and mince pies, goose, caudle
cup, “guid strang yell,” as they call
the home-brewed October, and a
huge bowl of punch. Intoxication
never happens at these Cumberland
feasts.</p>

<p>Among others, Mrs. Hemans once
had a cottage on Windermere called
“Dove’s Nest,” and wrote some
verses on the scenery, which are
well known; but she can hardly be
ranked with the school of “Lake
Poets.”</p>

<p>There is a queer old rhyme
current in the district, in itself a significant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
comment on the weather of
the country:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h2>SANDRINGHAM HOUSE.</h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/i_081-w.jpg" width="115" height="104" alt="W" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">WOLVERTON.&mdash;The
country in Norfolk is
real country and the
scenery is typically English.
The Prince Consort
could hardly have selected a more
suitable spot than Sandringham for
the country seat of the Heir Apparent;
and the fact that the Prince and
Princess of Wales make Sandringham
House their headquarters for the
greater part of the year has naturally
given an impetus to property in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Sandringham House is not a palace.
It is simply large, genial,
hospitable and attractive, like its
master. The Prince of Wales is a
much discussed man, and the ordinary
American who has not travelled
and who derives his knowledge of
English affairs from the American
daily papers&mdash;which usually give
only that side of the question which
is acceptable to the Liberals and
Radicals of Great Britain&mdash;has little
idea of his personality, and does not
begin to gauge the strength of his
character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince is usually supposed to
be a jovial, good-natured man who
devotes his whole time to pleasure,
and who has no ideal in life beyond
the pursuit of social gayeties and
field sports. This is a total and
gross mistake. The Prince of Wales
is one of the most hard-working men
in the Kingdom, and the humblest of
his future subjects has probably more
time to himself than the Heir Apparent;
and, I venture to say, does
not spend it half so usefully as this
much-abused Prince.</p>

<p>For many years he has been King
of England in everything but name,
and he is far more than the figurehead
of the nation. His knowledge
of public affairs is remarkable; he is
a master of diplomacy and his tact is
famous. Like his father, he possesses
a fine mind, and sometimes
displays a depth of foresight astonishing
even to his old friend, Mr.
Gladstone. He has a happy knack
of looking at all sides of a question,
and his mature judgment upon matters
of public import is often sought
by statesmen of all shades of opinion.</p>

<p>He has never meddled in politics,
and his success in steering a straight
course among the quicksands of
party passion and strife is well shown
by a dinner he gave in London only
the other day to the King of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Belgians, at which Mr. Gladstone sat
next to Lord Salisbury, and Mr. Balfour
chatted pleasantly with Mr.
John Morley. The Prince of Wales
alone could give such a dinner. A
fair estimate of the Prince is rarely
found in American papers. Because
he is Prince and will some day become
King, they think it their duty
to spatter his reputation with mud;
and to show their “Republican sympathies”
(I use the word in its widest
sense) by ill-digested diatribes
against royalty. The Conservative
party, like the English Court, has
hardly a representative among us,
and our knowledge of important
events on the other side usually
comes from a “Liberal” source. It
is evident that in many cases the
American papers know a bitter editorial
against the Prince of Wales
may serve some political end of
their own; and they never hesitate
to sacrifice him on such occasions.</p>

<p>It is no exaggeration to say that
the most popular man in England is
the Prince of Wales. Even the Radicals
cheer him, for he is always ready
to do anyone a good turn, while still
careful of his dignity. It is interesting
to note the Prince’s daily life at
Sandringham, his country seat, where
he appears as a simple Squire.</p>

<p>Saturday-to-Monday parties are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
frequent at Sandringham in the autumn
when the shooting has begun;
and often seven or eight gentlemen;
a General, an Admiral, a Diplomat
or two, with their wives, a foreign
Prince or Nobleman, and possibly a
Bishop, assemble on Friday evening.
These with the household officers
make up the party; and gathered
under the rose-shaded candles around
the flower-laden table in the dining
room they present a varied picture
of gay and stern humanity. No
sooner is the substantial dinner over
than McKay, the Scotch piper,
emerges from a neighbouring room
and intones some wild Scotch air on
his bag-pipes. In the evening the
Prince and Princess move from
group to group in the drawing room,
saying a few pleasant words to each
of the guests, and then withdraw to
their private apartments, while music
by some famous pianist usually closes
the evening. Baccarat is never
played at Sandringham, and the
smoking-room cohort breaks up
early. Breakfast is served at half-after-nine
(previous to which several
gongs have sent their echoes loudly
through the house) at small round
tables in the dining room, and the
meal must be quickly despatched,
for at eleven the carriages start for
the meeting-place, whether all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
guests are ready or not. A four-horse
drag carries eight or ten guests with
their guns and game bags; and an
array of dog-carts, village-carts and
various traps is at the disposal of the
remaining visitors. A breezy morning
on the moors is followed by a
merry al-fresco meal in a tent, where
curries from India await the Hindoo
Maharajahs, and a juicy ham sent by
the King of Portugal tempts the ordinary
appetite, while savoury Irish
stews show the Hibernian sympathies
of the Prince. The genial
Host always rides a grey cob to and
from the moors; at dusk the traps
and drags again appear; and the
party, indulging in cigars and lively
chat, returns gaily to the house.
After a change of garments and a
“tub,” they are just in the mood to
enjoy the comfort of the sitting room,
where the charming Princess presides
behind the tea tray, looking more
like a sister of her three tall daughters
than anything else. No one, of
course, really sits down to tea; each
one takes his cup and wanders
through the rooms, stopping to listen
for a moment to the piano, or to admire
the small green parrot who
gives three very emphatic and loyal
cheers for the Queen. When the
guests finally leave this most hospitable
and royal house they are sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
to find among their luggage at the
station a well-filled hamper of game.
Another morning the Prince takes
an early train to London, lays the
corner stone of a Masonic asylum;
drives to a new hospital which he
opens; presides over a meeting of
the British Bible Society; and then
attends a meeting at the Imperial
Institute, finally returning to Sandringham
by a late train.</p>

<p>The hearty cheers which meet him
in London on his way to and from
the station are, if anything, more
cordial than those which greet his
Royal Mother on her drives through
the town.</p>

<p>Very little of the Prince’s time is
spent in amusing himself. He is at
the nation’s disposal, and the nation
is a hard taskmaster. His is a
difficult position to fill, and in the
fierce, white light that beats upon a
throne, his slightest actions are distorted.
The present baccarat affair
is a good illustration of the way in
which the Prince’s affairs are twisted
to suit the scandal-loving readers of
the Radical press; but the storm of
adverse criticism now raging around
his head has already begun to create
a reaction in his favour, and thoughtful
people are commencing to ask
themselves whether it is quite fair to
shower so much abuse upon the Heir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Apparent for what is admitted to be
an error of judgment, but which
amounts to nothing more.</p>

<p>His attitude in this baccarat affair
has been strictly honourable, although
open to criticism. It may be worth
while to analyze the charges against
him. A slight examination will show
the flimsy character of the foundation
upon which they rest. In the
first place, people are under the impression
that the fact of his connection
in any way with the affair was
disgraceful. This view of the case
will hardly be accepted upon mature
reflection. When the Prince ran
down to Tranby Croft for a few
days’ rest, and in the evening sat
down to a friendly game of baccarat,
he never dreamed that one of his
oldest friends would deliberately try
to cheat him. With the fact of his
playing cards for money the world
has nothing to do. Each man must
decide for himself whether games of
chance when played for money are
wrong or right. It may be claimed
that the Prince was not a man, but a
Personage; but it is well to remember
that he played cards in his private
capacity and not as Heir Apparent.</p>

<p>The jury has decided that Sir
William Gordon-Cumming did cheat
at cards; and to any one knowing
the game, his very feeble explanation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
appears absurd; while the fact
that five witnesses saw him push his
counters over the line to add to his
stake at an improper time practically
places the matter beyond dispute.
The only fault that the Prince of
Wales committed was one of kindness.
He signed the paper, prepared
by Lord Coventry and General Owen
Williams, promising secrecy if Sir
William would agree never to touch
cards again.</p>

<p>That is: he, a Field Marshal of
the British Army, tacitly agreed to
allow Sir. William to remain in the
Army and in his regiment while
knowing that he had cheated at
cards. His duty as an officer was to
report Sir William’s conduct at once
to the Duke of Cambridge, the
Commander-in-Chief.</p>

<p>This he failed to do out of regard
for his friend; and for this he has
been so bitterly attacked in the
press! Again, he has been criticised
for his continued presence at
the trial, where he came&mdash;it was suggested&mdash;for
the purpose of muzzling
eminent Counsel. Can any one fail
to see what scorn and contempt the
press would have poured out upon
him had he failed to appear in person?
Every one would have said he
was afraid to be present.</p>

<p>No one recognizes more fully than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the Prince himself that an error of
judgment was committed when he
condoned Sir William’s offence; and
his recognition of this fact has been
proved by the apology offered in his
name by Mr. Stanhope, Secretary-of-State
for War, in the House of Commons.
All this talk and discussion
in England is merely froth on the
surface. The resolutions and strictures
passed by various Dissenting
bodies with much display of bad taste
appear to be equally due to a desire
on their part to condemn gambling in
high places, and at the same time to
draw public attention to themselves.
The lower-middle class and the agricultural
labourers, who compose the
great bulk of the population of England,
go placidly on their way, paying
no attention to this noisy affair and
only longing for their beef and beer.</p>

<p>The upper-middle class is more
deeply stirred; for does it not count
many a Mr. Pecksniff among its
members, and are not Mr. Stiggins
and Mr. Chadband to be met within
its chaste and highly moral circles?</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Prince
will be decidedly more careful in
future as to whom he admits to the
honour of his acquaintance. This
baccarat affair may cause him some
slight temporary loss of popularity,
but a generous fault often makes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
man more popular than a miserly
virtue; and the enthusiastic cheers
which greeted the Prince at Ascot
only a day or so ago are perhaps a
better indication of what the people
of England think of their future
King’s course in this matter.</p>

<p>A significant fact is Mr. Gladstone’s
loyal adherence to his Prince,
and his stern discouragement of the
intention of his unruly Radical colleagues
to attack the Prince in Parliament.
Mr. Labouchere, too, the
cynical editor of the Radical <i>Truth</i>,
as well as the Liberal <i>Daily News</i>,
supports the Prince; and the authors
and literary men whom he has so
often helped are rallying to his aid.</p>

<p>The Prince of Wales, like every
one, is mortal; but far more than his
great-uncle, King George IV., does
he deserve his well-earned title of
“The First Gentleman in Europe.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">CHARING CROSS.&mdash;A few
years ago Mr. Gladstone
brought down upon himself
a perfect hailstorm
of remonstrance, reproach
and denial by a statement in a
public letter, to a candidate for Parliamentary
honours in the Liberal
interest. This statement was to the
effect that no one ever now dreamed
of objecting to the Revolution of
1688, and its results. Previous to
this, the great majority of English
and Americans had thought the cause
of the Stuarts forever dead; and
that a romantic interest&mdash;chiefly
historical&mdash;alone remained of the intense
devotion shown to that fated
family in the unsuccessful risings of
1715 and 1745. But the great majority
was undeceived upon the appearance
of Mr. Gladstone’s letter,
and learned with a degree of sympathetic
amazement that there existed
in Great Britain two “Orders” or
“Leagues,” both aiming at the return
and recall of the heiress of the Stuarts,
to the throne of her ancestors.
One of these, the “Order of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
White Rose,” was merely platonic and
existed to gratify a passion for historical
romance on the part of its
members. Its principal object was to
hold meetings on the anniversary of
the death of Mary Queen of Scots,
King Charles I., and the battle of
Culloden&mdash;the battle that proved
the death-blow to the cause of the
gallant young “Pretender.” I say
its object “was,” advisedly; for the
stupid action of the powers that be,
on a certain day in February last
(1892), has changed its somewhat
lukewarm hero-worship to working
zeal, and has brought it into closer
relations with the other association:
the “Legitimist Jacobite League,”
This society makes no secret of
the fact that it meditates treason.
Its avowed purpose is to restore the
Stuarts; and on its books appear
the names of seven thousand people
devoted to its cause. Most of these
rebels in embryo hail from the Highlands,
where the old loyalty to the
Stuarts still exists, and where the
last desperate stand was made
against the bloodhounds of the
butcher-Duke of Cumberland.</p>

<p>This League always refers to Her
Majesty as “The Lady Victoria” and
recognizes as Queen the heiress of the
Stuarts&mdash;the wife of the oldest son of
the Prince Regent of Bavaria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>It would be interesting to digress
here and wander in the fascinating
paths of the genealogy and descent
of the Stuarts; but it would fill columns.
However, the Order of the
White Rose and the Jacobite League
are satisfied with the descent of the
Princess, and they are the ones chiefly
concerned. Lest my information be
considered apocryphal, I may say
that all my statements have been
verified by a member of the Order.
Lately the League has turned its
attention to Parliamentary matters,
and although the members consider
that the last legal Parliament was
held when King James II. was
cheated out of his throne by his
Dutch son-in-law, they are not above
agitating in a constitutional way, and
have secured several Legitimist candidates
to stand at the general election.
So to sum up in a few words:
Before last February there existed in
Great Britain two associations each
looking upon the present Royal Family
as usurpers, and each devoted to
the Stuart cause; one theoretically,
the other practically. Both these
associations had existed since the
rising of 1745, but in a more or less
chrysalis condition until Mr. Gladstone’s
letter aroused them to declare
themselves, when they were
amazed at the adherents that poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in from all over the United Kingdom&mdash;principally
from Scotland and
Ireland, many from England, but not
one from Wales.</p>

<p>Some of these recruits were animated
simply by a desire for something
new and were people who are
never happy unless in pursuit of
some interesting fad; but the majority
consisted of those whose ancestors
had fought either at Killiekrankie,
at Culloden or at Preston
Pans. There is more or less mystery
as to the attitude assumed by
the object of all these hopes. But
she is believed to take up a position
of innocuous desuetude, so to speak.
That is, if the royal lightning should
strike her, she would, like Barkis,
“be willin’;” but until the Jacobite
thunderstorm gathers, and the White
Rose lightning illumines the political
sky, she bides her time. For
Bavaria is at peace with England.
A glimpse at the incident of last
February before referred to and another
which happened a short time
before, may be instructive. Everyone
knows the statue of King
Charles the First, which stands at
Charing Cross. The Order of the
White Rose had decided to decorate
this statue of the King upon the anniversary
of his martyrdom, and about
three o’clock in the morning a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
band of zealous Jacobites, with
wreaths of white roses, gathered
near the statue&mdash;as on Primrose Day
the Conservatives gather to cover
the statue of the great Earl with
primroses&mdash;but to their annoyed surprise
a surly policeman was stationed
there who told them gruffly to “move
on”&mdash;that no decorations would be
allowed on or near the statue. Many
were the murmurs and loud the
remonstrances, but both were unavailing,
until one of the party sarcastically
inquired if they might
leave the wreaths at the foot of the
statue of George III. hard by. No
objection was made to this (mark the
distinction drawn!) but the Legitimist
sympathizers preferred to carry
their wreaths away as souvenirs, and
moved on with many muttered observations
on the “Hanoverian pack,”
hated of their fathers. Several of
the papers referred to this peculiar
action of the authorities with ridicule,
and blamed the Home Secretary for
giving an unnecessary prominence
to the lately resuscitated party.
This was the first thing which quickened
the lukewarm zeal of the Order
while it inflamed the ardour of the
League. The next blunder of the
authorities was more serious, and to
this may be ascribed the Stuart revival.
Of this incident I was fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
enough to be an eye witness.
I had happened to see a paragraph
in an obscure little evening paper on
the seventh of February to the effect
that as the next day was the
anniversary of the death of Mary
Queen of Scots, the Order of the
White Rose would form a procession
in Westminster Abbey to lay a
wreath upon her tomb. The Jacobite
League was not mentioned, but,
as events proved, many of its members
had learned of the purpose of
the Order and had arranged to be
present. Mindful of the refusal to
allow the Order to decorate King
Charles’s statue, and yet hardly
thinking that any opposition would
be offered to the attempt to honour
the memory of the unfortunate
Queen, especially as on that day
the Chapels Royal were opened to
the public, I arrived early at the
Abbey and as soon as I entered
could see that something unusual
was in the air. Small knots of people
were whispering in the nave,
and excited vergers bustled about,
dropping their h’s all over the Abbey.
The daily afternoon service was to
commence at half-past three, so
there was some anxiety to get the
function over.</p>

<p>The Marquis de Ruvigny&mdash;a name
familiar to all versed in the history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
of the Stuart cause&mdash;and Mr. Clifford
Mellish were waiting at the door for
the arrival of the wreaths, when the
appearance of a score of stalwart
police-constables created some surprise.
The majority of the strangers
present (there were about six hundred)
had evidently come for the
ceremony of placing the wreaths on
Queen Mary’s tomb and were waiting
silently and reverently until
everything should be ready. Fortunately,
as we all thought, the day
was one when the royal tombs were
open to visitors; but soon an ominous
murmur arose that the gates
leading to the chapels where the
royal tombs were had been closed.
The Marquis de Ruvigny indignantly
refused to believe that such a <i>bétise</i>
was possible on the part of the Dean;
but a surging of the now increasing,
crowd towards the chapels showed
that the gates were secured.</p>

<p>Then in no measured terms the
disgust and anger of the Jacobites
broke forth: “Intolerable Stupidity!”
“Afraid of the consequences!”
“Absurd!” “Idiotic!” were some
of the expressions used. But one
braw Scotchman summed up the situation
in a few words: “The government
has turned a romantic pilgrimage
into real treason, and has raised
us to the dignity of a political party.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
The leaders now got together near
the gates and talked earnestly while
waiting for the wreaths to come. I
was curious as to the effect of the
closing of the gates on the British
public in general, and wandered
through the Abbey, catching expressions
here and there. “It’s a
perfect shame,” exclaimed a rosy-cheeked
vicar evidently just up from
the country. “It makes me sympathize
with the Jacobites&mdash;the idea
of depriving Englishmen of their
right of free assembly.” And a stout
old gentleman near him, who was evidently
something in the city, turned
with the plaint: “My ancestors
lent King George the First money,
and I have always been a staunch
Hanoverian; but by Jove this is
too much. Do you suppose if these
people wished to decorate the tomb
of George III. or of Dutch William
they would be stopped?” And
many more spoke to the same effect.</p>

<p>The impression made on the general
public present was evidently bad.
But the sight of a well-known figure
pacing up the nave suggested Archdeacon
Farrar, and it was indeed he.
Soon the leaders of the abortive procession
spied him and entered into
eager expostulation, but all to no
purpose. Dean Bradley was in Algiers,
and the Canon-in-residence for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the time being (Canon Ainger) had
decided to close the Chapels Royal.
He could not interfere. But then
the large wreath appeared, a beautiful
affair of white roses and camellias,
and it was hastily decided to
affix it to the gates leading to the
royal tombs. Then a short, stout
man with sandy hair and beard
pressed forward, eager to take it.</p>

<p>“My grandfather, Robbie Anderson,
led the way for Prince Charlie
at the Battle of Preston Pans and
I’ll be proud to lead ye now,” he
said. A scarcely suppressed cheer
broke forth as the wreath was placed
on the gates, in which those of us
who claimed a touch of the old
Scotch Cavalier blood joined. A
card was attached, and by general
request the descendant of Robbie
Anderson read it aloud. I afterwards
copied it:</p>

<p>“In memory of Mary, Queen of
Great Britain, France and Scotland.
Presented by the Legitimist (Jacobite)
League. February 8th, 1892.”</p>

<p>Then as the inspectors from Scotland
Yard drew nearer, a red-faced
verger bustled through the crowd up
to the gates and pointing to the
wreath exclaimed, “Take that thing
down!” This gave rise to murmurs
of remonstrance and indignation and
the Marquis de Ruvigny spoke for all:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“I decline,” said the Marquis, “to
touch that wreath. Take it down
yourself.” But this the verger had
no orders to do, and retreated in discomfiture.
Then it was proposed to
hold a meeting in Deans’ Yard to
protest, but Mr. Stuart Mellor very
sensibly observed that it would do
no good to be arrested for brawling,
and that public opinion would know
what to think. And as most of the
Jacobites present were Catholics this
exclamation of one of them was to the
point and caused a quick clearance:</p>

<p>“I say, if we don’t look sharp, we
shall be in a Protestant place of
wash-up at time of service.” And
so the crowd faded gradually away,
and what but for the tact of the
leaders might have turned into a
“demonstration” in the Abbey, was
safely over. But the moral effect of
the gathering and the severe measures
used by the authorities has not yet
died away, and many Englishmen
who cared little for the Stuarts have
joined the Order or the League as protest
against this act of the government.
The Dean, I believe, refers
the matter to the Bishop of London,
and he mentions the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners more or less vaguely.
It is difficult, therefore, to fit the
blame. But there is no doubt that
this incident has given renewed force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to the Jacobite cause. Their Parliamentary
candidates are busy, and the
coming general election will afford a
practical test of their strength with
the common people. There is no
doubt that in Ireland they could secure
many seats if they tried, for the
Irishmen of the south still remember
the Battle of the Boyne.</p>

<p>Sensible people all around regret
the blunder of the government, and
as usual H. R. H., the Prince of Wales,
voiced the universal sentiment when
he declared the suppression of the
pilgrimage a shame.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he, “I would have
gone with them myself, and would
have worn a white rose, too, if they
had asked me.”</p>

<p>And no doubt if the Canon-in-residence,
or the Dean of Westminster, or
the Bishop of London, or the Ecclesiastical
Commissioners, or whoever
was responsible, had acted in
this sensible, unprejudiced way, the
incident would have closed and people
would have smiled at the archæological
enthusiasm of the Jacobites,
instead of thinking them hardly used,
and, ergo, sympathizing with them.</p>
